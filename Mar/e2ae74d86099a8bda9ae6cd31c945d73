The All Progressivs Congress (APC) in Gombe State has appealed to security operatives in the state to check the excesses of hoodlums who had been targeting the party.  Abdullahi Idriss, Chairman, Publicity Committee of the APC Campaign Council in the state, made the call at a news conference on Sunday in Gombe. He said the appeal had become necessary, alleging that thugs had taken to the destruction of APC campaign materials in recent times. He said that such menace portended grave danger to democracy in the forthcoming governorship election in the state. “We are therefore appealing to security operatives not to treat such nefarious act with kid’s glove,” he begged. He said that not more than 20 people were injured in a recent ugly  incident, adding that the act was not just a threat to democracy, but symbolised terrorism. Mr Bello Makwashi, Gombe State Commissioner of Police, had confirmed the allegation through the command’s spokesperson, DSP Merry Malum, saying investigations into a recent such incident was ongoing.
