Gov. Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa has advised Nigerian youths to shun cultism and drug abuse in order to become responsible citizens.  According to a statement issued by Mr Fidelis Soriwei, the governor’s Special Adviser on Media Relations, Dickson gave the advice on Monday in Yenagoa at an interactive forum with students of the University of Africa, Toru-Orua. The governor admonished students to indulge only in activities that would justify their parents’ and government’s investment in their education. He warned that cultism, drug abuse and other anti-social behaviour were capable of truncating their dream for a great future. Dickson noted that his administration was making investment in the education sector, which he described as the bedrock for sustainable development. The governor further stated that the government was committed to evolving policies that would stand the university out from its peers. He said: “The curriculum was carefully developed to inculcate entrepreneurship skills in the students and prepare them to be potential employers of labour even before graduation. “Government has already donated the School of Agriculture, Ofoni and the Bayelsa Integrated Farms at Ebedebiri to the university.” The statement further quoted Miss Okpoebi Tounaregha, a staff member of the university, to have commended the governor for his thoughtfulness in establishing the university. Tounaregha noted that the institution would not only enhance educational development in the state but also fast-track the urbanisation of the host community. The statement noted that Dickson carried out an unscheduled inspection of facilities at the university. On the governor’s entourage were the Commissioner for Education, Mr Jonathan Obuebite, Commissioner for Works and Housing, Mr. Godwin Konyefa, among other top government functionaries. He was guided on the tour by the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Valentine Aletor, and Registrar, Mr Francis Owusu-Mensah.
