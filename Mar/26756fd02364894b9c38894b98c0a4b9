Tottenham Hotspur beat hosts Borussia Dortmund 1-0 on Tuesday thanks to a Harry Kane winner, to stroll into the Champions League quarter-finals.  It was only the English clubâ€™s second time of reaching the quarter-finals of the elite European club competition in their history with a 4-0 aggregate victory. Kane, who missed the first leg through injury, fired in the winner shortly after the restart to silence a fiery home crowd. The goal left Dortmund needing five goals after having lost 3-0 in London last month. The Germans, who have seen their seven-point lead in the league evaporate in recent weeks and are also out of the German Cup, have never overturned a 3-0 first leg deficit in the competition. Despite a valiant effort in the first half, they were unable to score. For Tottenham, whose only other quarter-final appearance came in the 2010/11 season, it turned out to be an easier task than expected.
