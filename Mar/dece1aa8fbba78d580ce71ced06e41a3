Rampant Manchester City demolished a woeful Schalke 04 7-0 to complete a 10-2 aggregate win and become the third English side into the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday.  Manchester City’s record home win in Europe did not look likely after a quiet opening 35 minutes. But once Sergio Aguero began the rout from the penalty kick spot it became embarrassingly easy as Manchester City reached the last eight for the third time in four years. Aguero doubled Manchester City’s lead three minutes later and the impressive Leroy Sane made it 3-0 before halftime. Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva finished off flowing moves after the break and youngster Phil Foden bagged his first European goal before Gabriel Jesus made it seven. Manchester City, who trailed 2-1 in the away leg before turning it around late on, join Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter-finals. Liverpool, another English Premier League side in the tournament, will be in action against Bayern Munich on Wednesday.
