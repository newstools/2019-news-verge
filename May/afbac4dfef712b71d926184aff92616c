Mr Olugbenga Adebola, a waste management specialist, on Thursday advised the Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to ensure continuity in government’s policy on waste management sector in the state.  Adebola, the spokesman for the Waste Management Association of Nigeria (AWAM), Lagos State chapter, gave the advice in an interview with our reporter in Lagos. Adebola, who congratulated the governor on assumption of office, noted that the governor had called for a proposal from the waste sector to be included in the waste management policy. According to him, this can be adopted with a view to achieving a “new Lagos”. “We are expectant that His Excellency will continue to work with all the identified stakeholders within the waste management industry, especially the Private Sector Participation (PSP). “We hope his promise that his administration will adopt a zero waste initiative such as waste collection and conversion into useful material will be followed through. “We are also hoping to work with him to develop a sustainable and efficient house-to-house system of waste collection,” he said. Adebola said that the system of waste collection would involve collection and transportation to the final disposal facility where it would be treated or segregated and converted to useful material. He said that this would to solve the waste management problem in Lagos State. He said that this system of waste evacuation would eliminate wastes going into the drainage, thus indirectly preventing flooding. “Lagos is below sea level and anytime it rains, the wastes in the drains cause the unprecedented flooding in Lagos State.”
