Justice Nathaniel Ayo-Emmanuel of the Federal High Court, Ibadan, has overruled the objection of the defendants to the further amended charges in the alleged N8 billion CBN currency scam.  Recall that Patient Okoro, Sunday Adekunle-Ilori, Kolawole Babalola, Muniru Olaniran and Fatai Adedokun had on March 29, through their counsel, had objected to the application for further amendment of the charges leveled against them. Ayo-Emmanuel held that allowing the charges to be further amended would not have any negative effect on any of the parties concerned. “Except for count four which has just been included, all the other charges remain the same as they were in the old charges . “However, if the defendants desire to have a fresh plea, they are free to do so,” the judge said. However, when the further amended charges were read to each of the accused persons, they pleaded not guilty. With the plea, each of the defence counsel prayed the court for fresh testimonies and examinations of the witnesses that had been called by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). It was reported that Okoro, Adekunle-Ilori, Babalola, Olaniran and Adedokun along with others have since 2015 been facing multiple charges bordering on conspiracy, unlawful conversion, forgery, stealing and recirculation of mutilated currency at the Ibadan branch of CBN. Ayo-Emmanuel adjourned the case till July 1 and July 2 for the prosecution to reopen trial.
