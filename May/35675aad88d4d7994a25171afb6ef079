The Minister of Environment, Alhaji Suleiman Zarma, has urged contractors handling the remediation of oil spills in Ogoniland to deliver a quality work.  Zarma gave the advice in Abuja on Tuesday, when he met the five contractors recently approved by the Federal Executive Council, in addition to the 16 existing contractors. The minister told them that he would ensure that the ministry deployed its multi-layer monitoring and evaluation teams to achieve contract objectives. He said that contractors should rise up to support the Federal Government’s efforts in defending the Ogoni clean-up project. According to him, it is important for contractors to defend their work because the contract affects the work and the subsequent work you will apply for. The Project Coordinator, Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP), Dr Marvin Dekil, said that HYPREP was a Federal Government’s coordinating office saddled with responsibility of remediation. He said that it commenced the implementation of projects through consultation and sensitisation of communities. Dekil said that HYPREP adopted a robust process in arriving at selecting contractors to execute remediation project in Ogoniland. He said that the contracting companies had registered with Corporate Affairs Commission, adding that they had technical partners abroad to jointly deliver quality work. The coordinator, who described the contractors as competent, assured that they would remediate Ogoni oil spill to meet best practices and standard. The Project Management Consultant, Mr Eric Onyeiwu, said that he would ensure that the contract was executed in line with specifications within the agreed time.
