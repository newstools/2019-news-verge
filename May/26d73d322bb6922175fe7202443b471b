Nigerian equities market consolidated seven consecutive days downward movement on Tuesday with the crucial market indices dropping further by 0.22 per cent.  Our correspondent reports that the development was as a result of broad sell-offs pressure across major companies.

Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited said that “Our outlook for equities in the short to medium term remains conservative, amidst absence of a positive catalyst. However, stable macroeconomic fundamentals remain supportive of recovery in the long term.” Also, APT Securities and Funds Limited expected “further moderation of the ASI as foreign investors remain on the side-lines in the absence of major economic triggers; however, to be diluted by value investors positioning for long term.” However, market breadth returned to positive position, with 20 gainers against 16 losers.
