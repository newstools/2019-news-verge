Dr Akin Onigbinde, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, has commended University of Ibadan for taking the lead in addressing the challenge of leadership in the country.  Our correspondent reports that Onigbinde stated this in Ibadan on Thursday at the Third Stakeholders’ Forum of the University of Ibadan. Onigbinde urged the institution to constantly evolve innovative ways of reinventing itself for relevance and development. “One of the greatest areas of our national needs is in the area of leadership across board. “University of Ibadan must continue to identify areas of needs and address these directly and frontally. “University of Ibadan must carve a niche for itself in addressing the critical areas of needs, of pain and challenges of Nigeria. Prof. Idowu Olayinka, the Vice Chancellor of the university, said the institution was faced with challenges such as shortage of staff and poor funding. He added that inspite of the limitations of the university, it had continued to achieve great feats. “Two of the major problems hindering the realisation of our institutional goals and vision and also impede our academic productivity as well as global visibility and ranking are poor funding and unstable academic calender. “The university continues to improve on the state of the infrastructure in the campus,” he said.
