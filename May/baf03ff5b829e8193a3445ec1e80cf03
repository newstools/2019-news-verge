It, however, did not state how much was offered, but added that the maximum subscription was N50 million at N1, 000 per unit, subject to minimum subscription of N5, 000 and in multiples of N1, 000. The website said that the bond was fully backed by the full faith and credit of the Federal Government, with quarterly coupon payments to bondholders.
