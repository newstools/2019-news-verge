Acrivities on the Nigerian equities market maintained negative slide with the crucial market indices dropping further by 0.34 per cent following losses in 32 stocks.  Specifically, the All Share Index (ASI) lost 100.46 points or 0.34 per cent to 29,096.41 points in contrast with 29,196.87 achieved on Monday. Also, investors lost N37 billion in value as the market capitalisation declined to N10.936 trillion against N10.973 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Julius Berger, Okomu Oil, Dangote Flour Mills, Cadbury Nigeria and Zenith Bank. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said that “consequent on bearish performance and the weak investors sentiment, we opine that subsequent trading sessions will continue to be bearish in the near term.” Also, analysts at Cordros Capital said: “In our view, the sustained sell-offs in the Nigerian equities market is overdone compared to peer markets. This provides a basis for the ASI to recover in the absence of further downside risks. “Beyond the obvious, we believe that the blend of positive macro-economic fundamentals and compelling valuations supports our view of a near term recovery.” A breakdown of the price movement chart shows that market breadth was negative, with 11 gainers against 32 losers.
