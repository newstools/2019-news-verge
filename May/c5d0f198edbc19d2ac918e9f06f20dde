The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Ogun Command, on Friday said that 11,251 unclaimed driver’s licences were in its custody.  The figure is contained in a statement issued by the Command’s Spokesperson, Mrs Florence Okpe, and made available to newsmen in Abeokuta. According to her, the situation is worrisome because a number of drivers apprehended for traffic offences in the state had no valid licences. She, however, said that the command had intensified its enforcement drive, to improve highway safety in the state. “It is worrisome that most of those apprehended for driving without driver’s license have their driver’s licences produced, but lying uncollected at the various  Licensing Offices across the state. “As at May 3, there are 11, 251 driver’s licences unclaimed in Ogun, at the various licensing offices. “Motorists are hereby reminded that driving without a valid driver’s licence attracts a fine of N10, 000,” she said. She urged applicants to contact the FRSC Sector Command at the Ibara Housing Estate, Abeokuta, or the Ogun State Internal Revenue Service, Oke Mosan, Abeokuta, to check the list of unclaimed licences for collection.
