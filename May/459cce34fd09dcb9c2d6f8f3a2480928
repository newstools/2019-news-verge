The Nigerian Community in South Africa has congratulated presidential aide, Mrs Abike Dabiri, on her confirmation by the Senate as the Chairman/Chief Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission (NDC).  The President of the Nigerian Union in South Africa, Mr Adetola Olubajo, who congratulated her on Thursday, said that the confirmation of her appointment was a step in the right direction. “The union commends President Muhammadu Buhari for nominating her for the position and thank the Senate for affirming her nomination. “We urge the Diaspora Commission chairman to harmonise various Nigerian groups abroad for easy access and coordination. “This move will put Nigerians abroad under a platform that they will directly liaise and communicate with the Diaspora Commission. “We also appeal to the chairman to revisit Diaspora voting because it will give Nigerians abroad a sense of belonging and be part of the democratictc process at home,” he said in a statement made available to our reporter in Lagos. “Nigerians in the Diaspora want to contribute to the democratic process at home and one way of actualising this is through diaspora voting. “For us in South Africa, we commend the chairman for making a call for the reactivation of the Early Warning System aimed at alerting Nigerians in that country of imminent danger. “We are constrained to say that some Nigerians have lost their lives and property in South Africa due to the non-implementation of the Early Warning System. “The time has come for its implementation to save lives. “We pledge to cooperate with the chairman to enable the commission achieve set goals and objectives. We will also assist the commission to make the relations between Nigeria and South Africa harmonious.
