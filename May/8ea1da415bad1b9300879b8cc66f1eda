Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has attributed the continued peaceful coexistence in Nigeria to prayers.  The governor made the assertion on Wednesday in Akure while playing host to the leadership of the Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim and Seraphim led by its Prelate, Dr David Bob-Mannuel. Represented by his deputy, Hon. Agboola Ajayi, the governor expressed gratitude to religious leaders and urged them not to relent in their prayers. ”It is a wonderful thing to see men of God, both Christians and Muslims, doing what we don’t even ask them, but they feel obliged that it is our country and we must hold it together. “They always pray for the peace of the country, knowing when we have peace, we have everything. ”If you travel abroad or watch the television, you will see there is nothing compared with peace if you see what is going on in other countries. “But here, even when we Express fear over the approaching election, the Christians will go inside their bedrooms and pray. “The Muslims will go to their mosques and pray and everything will come and go quietly like that. ”This is not happening without the prayers of Christian brothers and sisters and Muslims,” he said. Earlier, Bob-Mannuel said the visit was part of the routine missionary exercise of the church. Bob-Manuel called on Christians and Nigerians at large to imbibe the fear of God as the panacea for the challenges being faced in the country. He urged them to seek righteousness first, while God would add other things. Bob-Mannuel charged Christians to exemplify the life of Jesus Christ in all their dealings, saying “Christianity is a practice, not mere oral confession.” The clergy man used the occasion to pray for the government and people of Ondo State and the country.
