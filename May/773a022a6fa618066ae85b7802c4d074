President Muhammadu Buhari has returned to Nigeria, after a 10-day ‘private visit’ to the United Kingdom. The president’s jet touched down at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, at about 6:24 p.m. A statement by his spokesperson, Femi Adesina, said some “reckless online media, irresponsible political opposition, and other bilious groups and individuals, had gone on overdrive since the President left the country on April 25, insinuating that he was going for hospitalization, and would not return after 10 days as stated.” Mr Adesisna also said in their “vain imaginations, they even stated that fictive doctors have advised President Buhari to stay longer for more intensive care”. He said now that the president has returned, “can these apostles of evil imaginings swallow their words? Can they retract their tendentious stories as well as press statements, and apologize to millions of Nigerians both at home and in the Diaspora that they have fed with hogwash?
