The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Geoffrey Onyeama has commended Nigerians in Malawi for projecting a positive image of Nigeria in that country.  Onyeama gave the commendation when he led a Federal Government delegation to deliver relief materials to the Government and people of Malawi, who were recently hit by Cyclone Idai. “I will like, on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, to thank you because in so many countries we hear all kinds of stories about our compatriots; not always the best of stories. “I must say that I have never heard any negative reports about Nigerians in Malawi. “I urge you to continue the good work to show the good side of Nigeria and Nigerians.’’ He said it was unfair to label all Nigerians as bad people because of the bad attitude of a few living in other countries. “This is always what we like to tell people, that you cannot tar all Nigerians with the same brush. “We have a lot of very good people, real ambassadors representing us very well around the world. “I will like to congratulate you all, and tell you how very proud we are of you that you are flying the Nigerian flag so high here in Malawi. It was reported that Onyeama on behalf of the Federal Government presented relief materials worth millions of Naira to Malawi to mitigate the impact of the disaster.
