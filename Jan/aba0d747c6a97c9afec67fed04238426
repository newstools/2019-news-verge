Gov. Tanko Al-Makura of Nasarawa State on Wednesday commenced  his senatorial campaign  with a call on the people to vote President Muhammadu Buhari and all candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC).  Al-Makura, who began the campaign for the Nasarawa South senatorial seat in Obi Local Government Area, said that the achievements of the APC so far were evidence of greater things to come. He noted that the Buhari administration had delivered on its three-pronged campaign promises of security, fight against corruption and revitalisation of the economy. Al-Makura said his administration had recorded tremendous achievements, especially infrastructural development. He promised to serve the people of the zone to the best of his ability, if elected as senator. The governor called on the people of the zone to be united and live in peace and harmony irrespective of religious or ethnic group. Al-Makura was earlier at the palace of the Osuko of Obi, Alh. Aliyu Dangiwa-Orume, to seek royal blessings. He assured the monarch of his commitment to the provision of more basic infrastructure to the area. The monarch, Dangiwa-Orume, in his response, commended Al-Makura for the developmental strides and peace building efforts. Our correspondent reports that Mr Yusuf Agabi, former governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), defected to the APC at the event. Agabi cited lack of internal democracy in the PDP as the reason for his defection, and urged his supporters to vote for Buhari and all APC candidates in the upcoming polls.
