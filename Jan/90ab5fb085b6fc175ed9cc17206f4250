He said that education provides the opportunity for people to improve their knowledge about the systems around them. The governor urged the council to utilise improved and innovative strategies in supporting the university to attain greater heights. He commended the university authorities for upholding the principle of excellence in academics and ensuring that the institution had been in operation for the past three years without any strike.
