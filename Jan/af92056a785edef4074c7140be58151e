Mr. Atiku Abubakar, the Presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday challenged President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to a new debate. Atiku took to his Twitter handle, @atiku to threw the challenge to the Presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) after both men failed to participate in the presidential debate organised by the Nigeria Elections Debate Group (NEDG) and the Broadcasting Organisations of Nigeria (BON) Saturday evening. Present at the debate, candidates of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili; Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN), Fela Durotoye; and Young Progressive Party (YPP), Kingsley Moghalu. The PDP candidate although apologised to Nigerians and the other presidential candidates present at the debate. He said, “with all due respect to my fellow candidates, Fela Durotoye, Oby Ezekwesili, Kingsley Moghalu and to the moderator Mark Sugar and with apologies to all Nigerians here and at home expecting an interesting debate, I regret that I will not be able to go on with this debate due to President Buhari’s absence.” In his word, “We came for a Presidential debate, not a candidacy debate, and I, Atiku Abubakar cannot challenge or question an administration where the man at the helm of the affairs of the nation is not present to defend himself or his policies. After all, you cannot shave a man’s head in his absence. I do not believe in attacking a man who is NOT here to defend himself. As a leader and former vice president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, let me first apologise to all Nigerians, my fellow candidates and the moderator for the APC Presidential Candidate’s absence in this debate. His non-appearance is a slight on ALL of us and our democracy. “I however challenge President Buhari to choose a date and time for a debate where he will be present and I will be there, hopefully with the other candidates as well.” READ ATIKU’S TWEET BELOW;
