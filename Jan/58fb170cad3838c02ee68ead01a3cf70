Tottenham Hotspur gained a slender advantage over London rivals Chelsea on Tuesday in their League Cup semi-final meeting as Harry Kane’s penalty kick earned them a 1-0 win at Wembley.  Kane’s 26th minute penalty kick, his 160th goal for the club, means Mauricio Pochettino’s side will be slight favourites to reach the final after the first leg match. But there is plenty of work still to do. The only goal of the evening arrived in unusual circumstances with referee Michael Oliver eventually awarding a penalty kick with the help of VAR. This was after Spurs skipper Kane was adjudged to have been marginally onside before being taken out by Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. Kane tucked away the penalty kick with his usual aplomb to move fourth, above Cliff Jones, on Tottenham’s all-time list of goalscorers. Chelsea, who were far better than in their 3-1 English Premier League defeat to Tottenham in November, could count themselves unlucky though. They twice hit the woodwork before the break and completely dominated the second half. Tottenham had to defend desperately at times and goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga was forced into making several sharp saves. The second leg will take place at Stamford Bridge on Jan. 24. Tottenham are looking to win their first silverware under manager Mauricio Pochettino and their first trophy since beating Chelsea in the 2008 League Cup final. Holders Manchester City face Burton Albion in the first leg of their semi-final on Wednesday.
