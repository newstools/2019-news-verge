The Presidency has called on the National Peace Committee to act on an alleged violation by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), of the peace accord signed by presidential candidates in December 2018.  In a statement on Tuesday, presidential spokesperson, Garba Shehu, accused the PDP presidential campaign organisation of bad faith, character assassination and inflammatory utterances. Shehu noted that the open and unsubstantiated allegations against the President’s family by the Atiku Abubakar media campaign contravened the spirit of the peace accord. The pact was signed at the instance of former Head of State,  Abdulsalami Abubakar, Bishop Mathew Kukah and other eminent public figures who constituted the committee. “Dragging the President’s family into the campaign and accusing them of wrongdoing without producing unassailable evidence, amounts to an act of bad faith and malice. “Instead of concentrating their efforts on persuading Nigerians on why they should be trusted to rule again after 16 years of failure, the PDP presidential campaign organisation is seeking to divert public attention from the large scale corruption and havoc it wrecked on the country during its 16 years of misrule.” He added that more than one week after accusing President Buhari’s family of corruption and wrong doing, the PDP presidential campaign still  could not provide proof of the allegations against them, despite being encouraged by the Presidency and the public to do so. “Instead, they are ridiculously expecting the accused to prove their own allegations instead of it being the other way round,” the presidential spokesman said. He accused the PDP presidential campaign of being indolent and poor in research. Shehu noted that it was irresponsible to go public with allegations that it could not prove, describing that as something other than politics. “It is sheer desperation and a clear sign of disarray in the PDP campaign,” he said.
