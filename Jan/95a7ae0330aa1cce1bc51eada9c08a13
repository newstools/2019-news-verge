Mr Labaran Maku, Nasarawa State Governorship Candidate of  the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), has commenced his campaign with a promise to transform the lives of the residents, if elected.  Maku, who began the campaign on Wednesday in Lafia, said that he would make security his priority. “I intend to address insecurity within my first 100 days in office, after which I  will focus on development of all the sectors. “The state, under me, will be a centre where people from other states will come and learn transparency in leaders. “We will  also set example for others to follow in genuine leadership in terms of due process, employment generation, carrier progression and infrastructural development in rural areas and towns,” he said. Mr Victor Oye, National Chairman of the party, in his speech, said that a vote for APGA was  a vote for liberation from poverty, hunger and insecurity. He urged the people to elect Maku as their next governor because he was eminently qualified for the position. It was reported that the party’s flags were presented to all candidates of the party in the state at the event.
