Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has announced restrictions of movement of trailers, tankers and other articulated vehicles into Lagos ahead of upcoming Access Bank International Marathon.  The marathon holds on Feb. 1 and Feb. 2. In a statement on Wednesday in Lagos, Sector Commander of the corps, Hyginus Omeje, said the days of the restriction are Feb. 1, Feb. 2, Feb. 8 and Feb. 9. Omeje said that the decision on the issue was reached at the end of a meeting of heads of security and traffic management agencies in the state. “This decision is in the general interest of the motoring public and also targeted at ensuring free-flow of traffic and forestalling of security breaches on the highways and other roads on the stated days. “Accordingly, a joint team of traffic and security agencies have been set up to ensure strict compliance with this directive. “Motorists found wanting will be severely reprimanded,” Omeje said.
