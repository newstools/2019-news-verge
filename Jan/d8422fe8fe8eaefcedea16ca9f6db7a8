Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr Ibrahim Magu, has called on Nigerians in the Diaspora to join hands with the commission in order to form a united front against corruption.  He said that this was the only way to move Nigeria forward in its quest for economic development, political stability and social justice. In a statement by the acting Head, Media and Publicity of the commission, Mr Tony Orilade, in Abuja on Monday, Magu spoke at the Nigerian American Business Forum in Tampa, Florida, United States. Magu was represented by EFCC’s Director of Planning, Policy and Statistics, Dr Ibrahim Gusau. “Considering that Nigeria has one of the most resilient, hardworking, intelligent and resourceful people in the Diaspora, it would be very tragic if we failed to tap into this immense potential,” he said. Magu commended Nigerians in the Diaspora for giving back to their country, noting that “it is on record that Nigerians in the Diaspora have remitted an average 22 billion dollars annually in the last two years. “This represents one of the highest remittals in the world, by the Diaspora to their home country, and so undoubtedly, you have a vital role to play in helping in this great fight against corruption,” he said.
