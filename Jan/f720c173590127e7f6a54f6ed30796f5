Sergio Aguero scored the only goal as Manchester City beat League One side Burton Albion 1-0 to secure a 10-0 aggregate victory in their League Cup semi-final on Wednesday.  The Argentine striker slotted home from a Riyad Mahrez cutback in the 26th minute as Manchester City set up a final clash against Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur. Pep Guardiola fielded a mixture of experienced and young players with Aguero, Mahrez and Kevin De Bruyne starting. He also handed a debut to winger Ian Poveda while young talents Eric Garcia and Philippe Sandler started in central defence. Manchester City demolished Burton, a league third division club, 9-0 in the first leg with four goals from Gabriel Jesus. There were also solitary strikes from De Bruyne, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Phil Foden, Kyle Walker and Mahrez.
