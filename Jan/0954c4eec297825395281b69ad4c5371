Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos has an adductor tear in his left thigh, and will be out for three weeks for the European champions.  The Germany international was injured during Real Madrid’s 2-0 home defeat by Real Sociedad on Saturday which left his side fifth in La Liga, 10 points behind leaders FC Barcelona. “(Kroos) has been diagnosed with a grade two tear of the adductor muscle in his left leg. His recovery will be monitored,” the club said in a statement. Kroos is set to miss the Copa del Rey last 16 games against Leganes, plus La Liga matches with Real Betis, Sevilla and Espanyol. Real Madrid, who were whistled off by their fans at a half-empty Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday, are already without the injured Gareth Bale, Marcos Llorente, Marco Asensio and Mariano Diaz.
