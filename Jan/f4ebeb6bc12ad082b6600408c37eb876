A Nigerian carrier, Air Peace says it will begin non-stop flights from Lagos to Banjul, The Gambia, from Jan. 7.  The airline made the announcement in a statement signed by its Corporate Communications Manager, Mr Chris Iwarah, on Sunday in Lagos. He said: ”We are pleased to announce the commencement of our non-stop flights to Banjul, the capital city of The Gambia, from Jan. 7. “We had routed our flights to Banjul through Accra, Ghana. The new schedule follows our experiment with direct flights from Lagos to Freetown. “The pieces of feedback we have received from members of the flying public indicate that they prefer to take direct flights to Freetown and Banjul. The option saves air travellers money and time.” He noted that the carrier had earlier broken its connecting flights to Freetown, Sierra Leone and now operates direct Lagos-Freetown-Lagos flights. Iwarah further disclosed that Air Peace was consolidating its leadership of air services on the West Coast of Africa with scheduling of more flights on the Accra, Ghana route. According to him, the development will avail travellers an exciting opportunity to cut cost and travel time. He said the airline would continue to adjust its schedules to better serve its customers on the West Coast of Africa. “We are a customer-centric airline and the strategy of our leadership of the airline business in Nigeria and West Africa is anchored on attaching great importance to the feedback of our esteemed customers,” Iwarah said.
