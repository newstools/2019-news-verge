The Kaduna State Internal Revenue Service (KDIRS) has introduced e-platform for online registration and renewal of motor license in the state.  Dr Zaid Abubakar, Executive Chairman of the agency disclosed this during a news conference in Kaduna on Monday, organised to present the agency’s scorecard in the last one year. Abubakar said that the measure was to block leakages and ease the process of registration and renewal of vehicle license in the state. “We have automated the processes of vehicle registration and licensing in Kaduna State and the e-platform will be ready by first week of January 2020. “Therefore, we are going to close down all our motor licensing offices so that vehicle owners can now register or renew their vehicle papers at the comfort of their homes or offices. “The vehicle owners can do that on their computer or mobile phones, without having any interface with KDIRS officials or offices,” he said. He added that vehicle owners can also procure number plates online and can choose from available options and pay within 24 hours at the comfort of their homes and offices. He expressed confidence that the measure would double the amount currently being generated across the motor licensing offices in the state. The executive chairman also said that the agency has upgraded its service portal to enable taxpayers upload their returns, pay their taxes and other revenues online. He said that taxpayers would also be able to apply for their tax clearance certificates and receive it online beginning from January 2020. According to him, the goal is to improve revenue generation by easing the business of tax payment in the state.
