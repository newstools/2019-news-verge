This is contained in a statement issued by his Press Secretary, Jibrin Gwamna and made available to our reporter in Lafia on Wednesday The speaker described the victory of the governor as a victory for democracy and confirmation of the peopleâ€™s choice who voted massively for Sule during the March 2019 election. Balarabe-Abdullahi noted that the Judgement brought to an end all litigations regarding the governorship election, and would give room for the governor to settle down and face the real business of governance. The speaker enjoined all citizens to bury their differences and work with the governor for the overall development of the state. He also advised the governor to be father to all so as to move the state forward. Balarabe-Abdullahi lauded the panel of judges for painstakingly delivering the judgment that reflected the true will and aspirations of the people of the state Recall that the Supreme Court on Wednesday in Abuja affirmed the election of Abdullahi Sule as the duly elected governor of the state in the March 2019 election. The seven-man panel of the Apex Court led by Justice Mary Peter-Odili dismissed the appeal filed by Umbugadu for lack of merit.
