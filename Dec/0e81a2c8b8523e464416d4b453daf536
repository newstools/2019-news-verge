The Department of State Services (DSS) has released the convener of the Revolution Now protest, Omoyele Sowore.
This comes hours after a Federal High Court in Abuja gave the agency 24 hours to release him from detention. According to Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, the DSS had no justifiable reason to continue to hold the defendant in custody, after she had signed the warrant for his release. Sowore, who is the Publisher of online news platform, Sahara Reporters, and a presidential candidate in the February 2019 elections, was arrested on August 3 â€“ just days to a planned protest against bad governance in the country.
