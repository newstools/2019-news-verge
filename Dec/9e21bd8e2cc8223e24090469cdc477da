The Ogun state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has described the Supreme Court verdict that affirmed the victory of the state governor Dapo Abiodun as a validation of the popular saying that “when God says yes, no man can say no.” In a press statement issued and signed by the Publicity Secretary of party’s Caretaker Committee, Tunde Oladunjoye, the party said the verdict of the Supreme Court, which was in concurrence with the earlier judgements of the Ogun State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal and that of the Court of Appeal, Ibadan, was a reaffirmation that Dapo Abiodun is God’s project.” “To us as a party, despite the harassment, violence and boasts of men, God spoke on March 9, 2019, the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court,  has spoken today, therefore the needless distraction arising from day-dreaming litigations and the court-shopping syndrome has been finally and permanently buried,” he said. “Our Governor can now squarely face the business of governance in the execution of mandate freely given to him by the people of Ogun State.” “We had maintained right from the onset that the governor’s clear victory at the election was a divine mandate and a true reflection of the choice of the people of Ogun State.” “It will be recalled that the Chairman of the Election Petition Tribunal, in a unanimous judgment described the Petition of our opponent and his mushroom party as “destined to fail”; the Court of Appeal in a unanimous said it “lacked merit”; and the Supreme Court concurred with the judgement of the lower courts.” “We congratulate Dapo Abiodun, the entire members of our party at all levels, we thank our leaders at the national level and we urge all genuine lovers of development in our dear Ogun State to join hands with the Omoluwabi Governor in taking the State to greater heights”, he concluded.
