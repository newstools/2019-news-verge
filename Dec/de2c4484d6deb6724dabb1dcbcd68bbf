She gave this advice on Friday during the 2019 Children’s Day in Ado-Ekiti. Fayemi urged the children to face their studies well in order to become useful to the society later in the future. She called on parents to always monitor their children’s ways of life, particularly the kind of friends they keep. The governor’s wife also advised parents to invest in their children’s education, as according to her, that is the only legacy parents can give their children. She stressed the need for parents to imbibe good values and morals in their children. Fayemi promised the children a happy celebration, assuring them of enough to eat and drink as they celebrated the occasion. Highlights of the event included the presence of the popular Yoruba artist, called ‘Ijebu’, who also encouraged the children to have interest in acting.
