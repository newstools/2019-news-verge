He said that his administration observed that Ondo was the only state without a tertiary health care facility among the South Western states in Nigeria. “This is now a thing of the past. We have also gotten accreditation in all the clinical service department in one year. “The project on the long term will yield returns that will continue to add value to the system for years to come. “It will place the state in particular and the country at large in the league of countries with good and adequate health care facilities,” he said. The governor said that the state had also made choices on behalf of the people in other areas of socio-economic system that had made life more comfortable in order to offer good governance. Earlier, Dr Wahab Adegbenro, the Commissioner for Health, had commended the governor for his unwaivering commitment to the provision of qualitative health care in the state.

He said the state’s mandate was to provide qualitative tertiary health care to the people and also mak Ondo a destination for medical tourism in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa.
