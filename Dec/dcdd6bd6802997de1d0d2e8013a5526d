Gov. Gboyega Oyetola of Osun, has called on Christians in the state, to emulate the great virtues of humility, love, peace, forgiveness and reconciliation, which are the reasons for Christmas celebration world over.  Oyetola made the call in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, and made available to newsmen in Osogbo on Tuesday. He reminded Christians of the humble beginning of Jesus, which saw him being delivered at a lowly manger; even though he was a king. “This is the season to humbly commune with God; thank Him for the gift of Christ. Let us love our neighbours and live in peace in the spirit of the season,” the governor said. While wishing the Christian faithful and Nigerians, a merry Christmas, Oyetola prayed for God to guide the country’s leaders on the path of virtues; of humility, fairness, selflessness and kindness for the peace and development of Nigeria. “Our Administration is poised to deliver sustainable development, through the provision of adequate, equitable and qualitative projects in all the sectors across the state. “As part of efforts to transform the economy of the state, we convened the Osun Economic and Investment Summit to unlock the business potential of Osun. “This will enhance the delivery of a prosperous state, where all the citizens shall have limitless opportunities to create wealth and contribute to the development of the state. “Our goal will be achieved when we all come together in love and peace, which is the whole essence of Christmas celebration. “I therefore, urge you to show love to your fellow citizens, as you go about celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ,” he said.
