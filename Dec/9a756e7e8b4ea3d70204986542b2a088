French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday said that he had invited the leaders of five Sahel countries to talks about France’s military support in their fight against extremist groups.  His announcement, after a summit of the NATO military alliance in London, came nine days after 13 French soldiers were killed in a helicopter collision during an operation against militants in Mali. Macron, who after the deaths said France was looking at “all strategic options”. He said he considered that the “legitimacy” of the six-year-old deployment was “confirmed” and that it was still “part of our security”. But he said that he expected the leaders of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger to “clarify and formalise what they are asking for from France and the international community’’. “France – the former colonial power in the region – could not accept ambiguity towards the anti-French movement,’’ Macron said. The national leaders also had to carry out “the necessary political work on their side so that our military and development work can really be of use’’, Macron said – singling out Mali and Burkina Faso. France has 4,500 troops based in Mali, Niger and Chad to combat militants in the region. Macron said that if the issues he wished to raise were clarified at the talks in Pau, southern France on Dec. 16, then he would look to “structure a new coalition around us with the European partners, who are already present’’.
