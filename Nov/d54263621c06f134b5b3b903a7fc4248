Chelsea FC on Saturday rise to second position in the Premier League, having played a game more than Manchester City, after a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge. Tammy Abraham scored his 10th Premier League goal for Chelsea in 52 minutes while Christian Pulisic goal sealed the win in 72 minutes. Abraham, 22-year-old striker became the youngest Blues player to reach double figures in the Premier League since Arjen Robben when he swept home following a clever Willian pass. Chelsea had found clear-cut chances hard to come by against a stubborn Palace side, whose manager Roy Hodgson was taking charge of his 300th game in Englandâ€™s top flight.
