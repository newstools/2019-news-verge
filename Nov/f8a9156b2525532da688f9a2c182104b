A group of protesters have stormed the headquarters of the Department of State Services (DSS) over the continued detention of the convener of the #RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore, and Bakare. This comes days after the DSS failed to comply with a Federal High Court’s order for their release, following a bail application. The service had claimed that it was yet to receive the order as at Friday November 8. The Public Relations Officer of the Service, Dr Peter Afunanya however, later confirmed that they had been served the bail order, but were yet to release the accused because nobody turned up to receive them. But contrary to the claims of the DSS, counsel to Sowore, Mr Femi Falana, noted that they deliberately refused to release his clients despite lawyers waiting at the agency’s headquarters for up to four hours on Friday.
He, thereafter, stated that two lawyers from his law firm had been directed to contact the management of the DSS for the release of their clients by 10:00 am on Saturday (November 9). hey were, however, still not released to the lawyers. A member of the legal team, Barrister Marshal Abubakar, who led a team of family members to the headquarters of the DSS to receive him, confirmed this to newsmen. Abubakar said after putting calls across through to some high ranking DSS officials, they were told to wait, as the persons who could authorise Sowore’s release were unavailable. Frustrated with the process, after nearly a week of the court order, supporters have now stormed the DSS office over the continued detention. Deji Adeyanju is among those who have arrived at the venue.
