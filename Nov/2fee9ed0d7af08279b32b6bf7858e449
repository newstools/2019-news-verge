The Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mr Mohammed Adamu, has commended medical officers in the police for their professionalism and commitment.  Adamu gave the commendation on Thursday in Abuja at the opening of the Force Medical Officers (FMOs) conference. The conference with the theme, “Addressing Job Related Stress and Mental Health of Police Personnel” was organised for zonal and heads of police medical facilities across the country. He said the Police Medical Services was a critical component of his vision to improve the Nigeria Police and urged the officers to continue to support his aspirations. “We shall continue to support you and ensure that the challenges against your commitment to quality medical service delivery are addressed. “In so doing, particular attention shall be placed on your career and welfare concerns,” he said. Adamu said policing was a physically, mentally and psychologically demanding career. He said the constant exposure to traumatic incidents in the line of duty can impact negatively on the mental and overall health of police personnel. He urged the medical officers to consistently strengthen their institutional and personnel capacity to respond in the most professional manner to the occupational reality. The IGP said the idea was to ensure that police personnel were fit at all times for optimal performance of their statutory duties. “It is my expectation that the outcome of this conference will assist the police leadership in addressing the negative impact of job-related stress on the mental health of Police personnel,” he said. In her remark, Mrs Obembe Modupe, the Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) in charge of the Force Medical Services said the conference was a platform for participants to interact, learn and audit their activities.
