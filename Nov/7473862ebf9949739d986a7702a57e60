Rwandan President Paul Kagame on Thursday issued a warning to persons trying to “destabilise Rwanda”, including those backed by foreign forces, saying that they could bear a heavy cost for their actions.  “I want to warn some people among us who hide behind different things. “They hide behind politics, democracy, and freedom that we actually want,” Kagame told a ceremony swearing in newly appointed cabinet ministers and senior military officers, at the parliament in the capital city, Kigali. “We are going to raise the cost on the part of anybody who wants to destabilise our security,” he said, adding that the cost is going to be “very high.” “The people behind this nonsense and even backed and praised by people from outside, and become excited, are going to face it rough. “Those involved, they better come clean very fast,” Kagame stressed. Newly appointed Minister of Internal Security Patrick Nyamvumba, Minister of Environment Jeanne d’Arc Mujawamariya, and Minister of Sports Aurore Mimosa Munyangaju were sworn in at the ceremony. Other cabinet members who were sworn in included Minister of State in charge of the Youth and Culture Edouard Bamporiki and Minister of State in charge of Social Affairs Ignatienne Nyirarukundo. Chief of Defense Staff Jean Bosco Kazura of the national army, Rwanda Defense Force, and other senior army officials also took an oath of office at the ceremony.
