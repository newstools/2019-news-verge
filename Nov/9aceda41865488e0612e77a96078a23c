Katsina State Government says it has carried out 80 per cent coverage of immunisation against yellow fever disease across the state.  Gov. Aminu Masari made this known in Katsina while declaring State of Emergency on water and sanitation on Wednesday. He said “the state government, in collaboration with donor agencies has procured seven million vaccines aimed at carrying out intensive vaccination of citizens. “We have so far immunised 6.2 million persons from the age of five years to 45 years.” Masari disclosed that state government investigations revealed that people residing in local government areas close to the forest in the state fall victims to the disease. He added that the state’s Ministry of Health had been mandated to keep monitoring health situations in local government areas with the aim of keeping the state safe. He explained that health experts in council areas had been directed to report any strange disease to the state’s health management agency for prompt action. The governor called on the citizens to keep their surroundings clean and avoid open defecation to avoid health implications.
