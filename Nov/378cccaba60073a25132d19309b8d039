Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Tuesday commended the Council of Traditional Rulers in the state for its collaboration in curbing the rising spate of insecurity within the last two years.  Akeredolu made the commendation in Akure during the inauguration ceremony of the new Ondo State Council of Traditional Rulers. He said that the council had helped in tackling the menace of kidnapping and ritual killings and had supported various efforts aimed at resolving the frosty relationship between farmers and herdsmen in the state. “Our administration does not play down the roles of traditional rulers and their contributions to governance through regular counselling particularly when it comes to matters affecting good governance in the State. “I also express my profound appreciation to your majesties for the stabilising roles that you played during the last general elections. “You all rose to the occasion when we needed your support. You have never abandoned our administration and we are grateful for this. “Our administration is not unaware of your concern on some matters affecting your welfare and rights as Obas, many of which I believe , will be tabled for discussion at this forum. “Permit me to say that your welfare remains paramount in the mind of our administration. “Let me assure Your Majesties that we will always take decisions in good faith in the overall interest of our people,” he said. Responding, Oba Obateru Akinruntan, the Olugbo of Ugboland and Chairman, Council of Traditional Rulers in the Ondo State, appreciated the governor for the great honor and trust reposed in him. He promised to always give his best, and ensure the continued support of the council to the present administration in order to move the state forward. “I also use this medium to implore my fellow monarchs in the state to join hands in sustaining our governor and the government of the day in all ramifications,” he said.
