The newly appointed Chief Executive Officer of Wakanow.com Limited, Mr. Adebayo Adedeji has promised to focus on customer satisfaction, innovation, expansion and automation. Mr. Adedeji made the disclosure during his inaugural media interactive session which took place at the corporate head office of the company in Lagos. In his words: “Our number one goal is to ensure that our customers not only get the best, value-adding travel products and services but also that their experience is the best it can be, from the moment of first contact, online or offline. This includes a smooth booking process, reliable turnaround times, and a quality that exceeds your expectations. We realize we may not meet that goal 100% of the time, but we won’t stop improving until we do”. While reaffirming Wakanow’s position as Nigeria’s No 1 online travel agency, Adedeji stated that the company’s “strength lies in our innovative travel solutions, ranging from Pay-Small-Small, which is an instalmental payment plan for travel products and our value-adding ancillary products launched within the last few months which include automated flight reminders, airline liquidation insurance, lost baggage insurance, seat selection, airport protocol services and so much more”. “At the heart of our market leadership is innovation and more than ever before, we are committed to being first to market with game-changing travel solutions”, he added. On expansion and automation, the new CEO said: “We are committed to expanding our customer touch points both online and offline in order to bring travel closer to our customers. To this end, we are proud to announce partnerships with key strategic institutions with the requisite spread and network, both online and offline. With these partnerships we are able to serve even more customers across the globe”. It would be recalled that Wakanow launched a WhatsApp self-service channel recently. Through this first-of-its kind innovation in the travel industry, staff of the company are able to connect with customers on their phones right where they are.
