A statement by DCP Frank Mba, the Force Public Relations Officer, on Wednesday in Abuja said the I-G had directed the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Commissioner of Police to provide a “personal and round-the-clock supervision” of the investigation.

He said the investigation would include the forensic analysis of the video currently in circulation as well as the actions/inactions of the policeman seen in the video footage. According to him, the I-G assures citizens of utmost professionalism by the Police in handling the matter. “The police boss has promised that the force will ensure that justice is manifestly done,” he said. Mba said the I-G commended Nigerians for their massive show of empathy and concern for the rights of their fellow citizen. He called for continuous citizens’ engagement in the fight against the wider security challenges confronting the country.
