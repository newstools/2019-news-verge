 Mayor of New York City, Mr Bill de Blasio on Sunday assured the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning, and Intersex (LGBTQI) community of equal right and restoration of benefits to dishonourably discharged LGBT military veterans if elected President of the United States in 2020 election. Blasio, who addressed journalists at the closing ceremony of a month-long WorldPride celebration held in Times Square explained that the country is not known for hate and division but assured if his political party (Democrat) is returned to the White House, he will end the discrimination.  Earlier on the podium while addressing the congregation LGBTQI community, the Mayor promised to reverse President Donald Trump’s ban on transgender people serving in the military. “Those Americans, those young men and women, serving our country were dishonourably discharged because of who they love and who they were,” he said. “It was wrong. It was unfair to each and every one of them.” The mayor said there are as many as 100,000 veterans who have received a less than honourable discharge because of their sexual orientation. He also added that the existing appeals process is a “broken” policy. “It is a cumbersome procedure, and it puts the onus on the veteran who served us and didn’t do anything wrong,” he said. The 2020 Democratic longshot whose net favorability rating is the lowest among 22 major candidates said nothing about what he’d do to bolster the LGBTQ community in New York. NEWSVERGE recall that other Democratic candidates — including Warren, Senator Booker and Gillibrand, as well as former US Rep. Beto O’Rourke and Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg — have also said they would reverse Trump’s transgender military ban.
