As some Nigerians are still struggling believing Busola Dakolo’s rape allegation against the Senior Pastor of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), Biodun Fatoyinbo, another member who also work in the church office has opened up on the Pastor forcefully slept with her without her permission. The victim who spoke under anonymity in a new video released by YNaija’s Chude Jideonwo, said “To understand how much fear Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo inspires in the subject of our next interview; we will tell you how much censoring we had to concede to just to get the interview at the extent we share today,” revealed YNaija. “It took significant motivation to even get our interviewee in the right frame of mind to tell her story. We sat quietly with her, patiently too. And then she was forced to process the trauma of her experience in front of a crew of strangers. “We were initially supposed to obscure her face, but she felt so unsettled by the possibility of being recognized. Without much of a choice, we eventually blurred most of her visible frame. “We had a box of tissues handy for her intermittent use, because retelling her story overwhelmed her, even now when the majority seems in support of her. “She tells the story honestly, on the reasonable hope that her story – her experience – will build on the impact of Busola Dakolo and Ese Walter’s stories; and also shed more light on the crimes of an alleged serial rapist, as well as the system that enables him.”
