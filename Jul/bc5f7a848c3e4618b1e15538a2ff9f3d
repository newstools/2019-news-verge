Truth is, you can still find your spouse uninteresting, unappealing and yes, out of love with them.
You might even regret marrying them. You might just wish they never crossed your path. These things are natural. They happen to a very large number of people all over the world. So it’s not just unique to you. WHAT TO DO…
I will be speaking more to women because l am a woman and l feel l know more of what works for me as a woman than for men. TAKE A BREAK… The moment it gets to a stage where you start feeling little or less about your husband, take some time off. Go to your father’s house on a break. Or go on a holiday and lodge alone at a hotel if you can. But first, talk to him about it, tell him you want to be alone for a while. While there, you might be needing to jot stuffs down about the good days, what brought you two together, what about him appeals to you mostly. Think of all the good things he has done for you. Of all the days he made you smile. Then, think of the ones you didn’t like about him, his reactions to them, weigh them side by side. But then, don’t be too judgemental as we all have our flaws, you do too. Sometimes, distance makes us miss certain things about our loved ones. You are sure what feelings you have for someone when you are not together. Also, staying away may somehow reignite that first day spark. They will miss you, they will get to know your worth. Your absence would be felt. They would want you to return asap to fill that missing space. If home is worth going back to after thinking through, then be positive and more optimistic of making it work. You just need to see his/her wonderful side and less of the negatives. But if after some days away and you do not feel same way… Oh well, lol. Maybe something else might help… NB: Feel free to argue this. Let’s read your thoughts. Criticize this point, but constructively.
