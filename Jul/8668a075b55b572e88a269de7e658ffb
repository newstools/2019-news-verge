Dear Beautiful Woman, I am sure by now, you know you are very beautiful, have great curves, beautiful legs, lovely eye colour, a flawless skin and a nice dentition…. But in all these, do you know that there are women who are even more beautiful than you are? See, do not let your beauty get into your head so much that you think others will have to worship and “bow” in adoration of you always. Those of you who are: TOO beautiful to cook TOO beautiful to do chores. TOO beautiful to respect a man, your man! TOO beautiful to say “Please” TOO beautiful to manage the “little” boo has because “others” are giving women “more” out there. You are even TOO beautiful to show courtesy to that “ugly” man who shows you unconditional love, pays your bills, while you order him around. TOO beautiful to carry pregnancy, forgetting Queen Bey, a beautiful goddess, recently had her twins…. You fine pass her na See, nobody fine finish ooo….  No matter how beautiful you are, you definitely have certain flaws…. And you know it. The fact that a man “worships” you today, and is ready to take all your several bullshits doesn’t mean he is stupid….. There are a thousand and one beautiful women out there who would worship that very man you so look down on…. Slow down ma…. Nobody fine finish! Work on yourself….. Not necessarily for that man, but for your own peace. As long as he respects you, and plays his own manly roles, please drop your pride and be loyal. Discuss your differences and do your best to make it work. And you, wey no “fine”, come carry bad character join body, ok oooooo. Let’s be guided
