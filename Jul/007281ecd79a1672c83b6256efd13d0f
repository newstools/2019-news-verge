Prof. Joseph Obansa of the Economic Department, University of Abuja, has urged the Federal Government to consult widely before implementing its proposed ‘Ruga Settlement’.  The lecturer told our reporter on Tuesday in Abuja that there was need for government to engage all stakeholders, to get their views on best ways to go about it. Ruga settlement is a proposal by the Federal Government to end reoccurring conflict between farmers and nomadic herdsmen. The settlement will provide herdsmen and other animal farmers with basic amenities such as schools, hospitals, road networks, vet clinic, markets and manufacturing entities that will process and add value to meat and animal products. The don enjoined the federal government to sensitise all stakeholders involved with a view to having understanding of what the proposed settlement entail. “The Federal Government has good intention, but I still believe consultation has not been done, which is the reason for the negative reactions from concerned citizens. “A project like this needs wide consultation and massive awareness creation through the media before any implementation. “The government must be careful not to use force, but to take its time to educate the major stakeholders on the benefit of this project,”he said. The professor also emphasised on the need to resolve farmers/herdsmen clash before it could have setback on the agricultural sector. He said that the sector was important to the growth of GDP and the diversification of the economy. He added that farmers/herdsmen clash, if not well tackled is capable of derailing the successes recorded in the agriculture sector and the economy in general. Obansa urged government to be more proactive in tackling farmers/herdermen clashes and ensure peace among the major stakeholders in agricultural sector.
