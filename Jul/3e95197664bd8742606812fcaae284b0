The bearish performance of the Nigerian equities market extended into the third consecutive sessions on Wednesday as sale pressures in high capitalised stocks dragged the benchmark index by 0.07 per cent lower.  Specifically, the All Share Index (ASI) shed 19.89 points, representing a dip of 0.07 per cent to close at 29,375.25 against 29, 395.14 achieved on Tuesday. Similarly, the market capitalisation shed N9 billion to close at N12.948 trillion in contrast with N12.956 trillion posted on Tuesday. The market performance was influenced by price depreciation in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which are, Mobil Nigeria, Total Nigeria, Okomu Oil, Julius Berger and Fidson Healthcare. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said: “Market performance was bearish, and we expect this to be sustained in subsequent sessions as investor sentiment stays soft. “We do not rule out the possibility of some end of the week bargain hunting as investors take advantage of attractive market prices.” Market breadth was negative with 16 gainers against 23 losers.
