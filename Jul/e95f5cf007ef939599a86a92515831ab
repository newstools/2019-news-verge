Oyetola said his administration remained committed to supporting all citizens by prioritising their welfare. “I must reassure you of our commitment to build a state aspired by all. “We will not renege on our promises to take care of your welfare’’ he said. Oyetola commended the motorcyclists for the honour given to him and the state. In his remarks, Alhaji Ismail Tiamiyu, the Chairman of the association, said they would continue to support the government in moving the state forward. Tiamiyu said the rally was organised to identify with the governor and demonstrate the loyalty and commitment of the riders to his administration. “We will continue to support the state in our own little way, to be part of success story of this government,’’ he said.
