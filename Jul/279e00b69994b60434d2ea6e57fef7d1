He said that his government would begin immediate intervention in the SMEs to boost youth empowerment and employment. “I’m very impressed with what I have seen. My government will intervene in supporting agric-business in the state through the Anchor Borrowers Scheme of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). “Our focal point is enterprise and we’ll get more youths involved. It is going to be a win-win situation. “We will support them so that they can also pay taxes to the government,” the governor said. While assuring of enabling environment to operate, he also promised to support the entrepreneurs in expanding their businesses. He urged youths in the state to be more enterprising so that they too would be able to contribute their quota towards improving the economy. Mr Musbau Alasinrin, the Chief Executive of the firm, had, while conducting the governor round, described fishery as very a lucrative business and urged youths in particular to pick interest in it. Alasinrin explained that the farm had embarked on earth systems due to its capacity to accommodate large quantity of fishes.
