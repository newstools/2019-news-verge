The Jigawa Primary Health Care Development Agency (JPHCDA) on Monday says it vaccinated 55,774 children in Mallammadori Local Government Area of the state under the April round of Immunization Plus Days (IPDs).  Alhaji Usman Bilyaminu, State Technical Facilitator (STF), Polio Immunization, in the area, made the disclosure to our reporter in Mallammadori. He said 59,300 doses of Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV) were used in the exercise, and the wasted rate of the vaccines stood at seven per cent. Bilyaminu thanked the local government council for donating biscuits and chocolates used to lure children during the exercise.
