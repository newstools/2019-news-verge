The Ogun state government has begun an extensive palliative measures on the 32Km Sango Ojodu Abiodun road. The Sango-Ojodu-Abiodun road is one of the roads which was awarded and abandoned by the immediate past administration in Ogun state. The socioeconomic activities along this axis has been greatly affected due to the neglect of the road based on claim of paucity of funds by the previous government. The road which cut across various border communities between Lagos and Ogun State has been in the state of comatose before the emergence of the present administration of Prince Dapo Abiodun. To bring succor to the lives of the people living along that axis, the Ogun state governor Prince Dapo Abiodun few days ago directed that immediate palliative measures should begin on the road. The governor has also promised that the road remains one of his top priorities as soon as the rainy season goes down. The governor promised to ensure the completion of the road project which had undergone over 300% variation in its cost of construction during the past administration. It will be recalled that the road was awarded at a cost of N12bn in 2012 and the immediate past administration later gave the cost as N70bn with N22bn already expended on 5 flyover bridges along that road. Residents along the road has commended the state governor Prince Dapo Abiodun for coming to their aid. They appreciate the governor for the extensive palliative measures and pleaded that the road should be completed after the rainy season had gone down.
