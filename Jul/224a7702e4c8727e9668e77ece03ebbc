The Progressive Students Movement (PSM), a Pan-African student group, has advised the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), to get a Start-up Loan for graduates undergoing skills training in the scheme.  The President of PSM Nigeria, Mr Bestman Okereafor, made the appeal in a statement made available to our reporter on Wednesday in Enugu. Okereafor noted that the corps members should consider helping every Nigerian graduate with at least N1 million as Start-up Loan for skill enhancement. According to him, this is to enable them practice the entrepreneurial skill that they had acquired during the orientation course. “Nigeria has no fewer than 20 million unemployed graduates and our institutions keep producing millions of fresh graduates yearly. “We have no doubt that this idea, when adopted, will go a long way in reducing the increasing number of unemployed Nigeria graduates,’’ he said. Okereafor also advised the NYSC authorities to pay more emphasis on challenges of welfare, accommodation and security faced by corps members on daily basis in the discharge of their one year service year.
