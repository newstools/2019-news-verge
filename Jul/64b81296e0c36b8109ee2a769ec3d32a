Feminism is NOT war against men…
Feminism isn’t about hating on men.
Those of you women who are joining this cause because one man broke your heart or cheated on you and you want revenge…
Please don’t be confused.
This is not the aim of this movement.
Feminism is all about “Seeing women as humans who deserve rights such as given to men too”
No, not to shift roles; Not to rub shoulders; not to spite; not to hate…
Men will never push babies through their penises, so we are not fighting to be given powers to impregnate either….
We know our own roles and responsibilities, in the society, at home and the world at large…
Let’s all respect same…
And while doing that…
Recognize our rights, not as lower beings…
But as humans, with the same level of respect, recognition, payment, and be given same opportunities deserving.
To give the girl child same opportunities to explore such as given the boy…
To not relegate the wife to some corners in the kitchen when she can as well earn a name for herself…
If you are claiming feminism because you are looking for an umbrella to bash men and drag them…
You have gotten it all wrong…
Trust me on this.
