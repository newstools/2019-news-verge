A Federal High Court in Lagos, on Friday, ordered the interim forfeiture of Jewelry and Customised Gold iPhone, belonging to a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Allison-Madueke.  The properties are all valued at 40 million dollars. Justice Nicholas Oweibo, ordered that the items be temporarily forfeited to the Federal Government following an ex parte application filed and moved by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The Commission through its Counsel, Mr Rotimi Oyedepo, said that it found and recovered the properties, which is believed to be acquired with proceeds of unlawful activities. The application, titled action in rem, had Diezani as the only defendant and it was brought pursuant to Section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud and other related Offences Act, No. 14, 2006. EFCC said it found and recovered the properties on the premises of the respondent, adding that it reasonably suspected that the former minister acquired them with “proceeds of unlawful activities.” The court has adjourned the case until July 22.
