The Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, has warmed corps members against unauthorised journeys that had resulted in avoidable deaths of corps members.  The D-G gave this warning while addressing corps members participating in the 2019 Batch ‘B’ Stream One orientation course in Enugu. He also used the occasion to remind the corps members that only the NYSC State Coordinator had the powers to approve such journeys. He appealed to corps members to always consider the implications of their action and inaction before they carry them out. The NYSC boss advised them to distant themselves from criminal and fraudulent acts in order to be good ambassadors of the scheme and their families. The director-general said that the orientation course was aimed at fostering cohesion, discipline, orderliness, and team spirit amongst corps members, “Be good representatives of the scheme and add value to your host communities and the organisations you will find yourself working with,” he said. Ibrahim encouraged them to take advantage of the NYSC Skill Acquisition Programme, adding that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), was willing to provide the scheme with loan facilities. “Open your hearts and minds. Be focused and pick any of the trade to learn. We are in discussion with the CBN, it’s willing to avail us with loan facilities,” he said. Ibrahim said that a situation where corps members were thrown into the labour market after the service year was no longer acceptable, adding that they could be self-employed. Earlier, the NYSC State Coordinator, Mr Stephen Dewan, said that the corps members had been of good behaviour since the orientation course opened. Dewan thanked the D-G for the support given to the state office towards ensuring the success of the orientation camp.
