Gov. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has pledged to give security a boost in the state.  Makinde made the pledge on Wednesday in Ibadan when he visited the headquarters of the State Joint Security Task Force known as ”Operation Burst.” He said his administration would focus on the economy, education, health and security. The governor said that the first three priorities could be effectively achieved if adequate security was put in place. He commended the personnel of the outfit for the good job they were doing, noting that their mode of operation had restored confidence in them. The governor said the outfit would be re-launched to enhance its operations within 100 days of his administration. He asked Brig.-Gen. Oluyinka Soyele, the Commander of the Joint Task Force, to provide his office with what the outfit needed for urgent attention. Earlier, Soyele had informed the governor that the outfit comprised of men of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, Police, Air Force, DSS and army. He urged the governor to assist the outfit in tackling its logistic challenges in order to perform optimally.
