The leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Uhunmwode Local Government Area (LGA) of Edo, has confirmed the suspension of member-elect from the council, Hon. Washington Osifo, from the party.  Chairman of the party in Uhunmwode, Mr Johnson Omoruyi, confirmed the suspension during an interview with Journalists in Benin, on Monday. Omoruyi said the suspension followed the Osifo’s failure to heed to warnings from the party asking him to tow the path of honour. “He should know why we voted him into power. He should tell us if he has issues bothering him so we can resolve them with him, before the state governor and the entire Local government Council.’’ The LGA’s Publicity Secretary of the Party, Hon. Daniel Ogbewe, said while the suspension lasts, the door was open for Osifo to have a rethink and he would be accepted back into the party. It was reported that Osifo is among the remaining 13 lawmakers elect in the Edo House of Assembly that are yet to be inaugurated.
