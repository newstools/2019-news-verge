Cross River State-born gay rights activist, Oliver Anene, has called on Nigerians to show understanding and tolerance for people with different social, political and sexual preferences. Doing that, according to him, is the mark of rationality as well as civility. It is also the best way to guaranteed love, peace and a healthy coexistence. Anene, who was sighted with his gay husband, Alex, in Times Square, New York on Sunday at the closing ceremony of the WorldPride parade, told NEWSVERGE that Nigerians have their own freedom just like the rest of the world, stressing that freedom is not the problem in the country but tolerance for peaceful coexistence. According to the activist, Nigerians must see beyond who anyone sleeps with or how they sleep with them but “we must all accept one another for peaceful living”. When asked on the reception from his family since his declaration as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning, and Intersex (LGBTQI), Oliver, said he received amazing support from his parents who are well aware of his way of life. He believes that everyone has the right to choose whoever they want to be, noting that “freedom of association is never a problem in Nigeria just like the rest of the world.” Anene, who dismissed claims that LGBTQI are a minority in Nigeria, said they only need love and to be supported. “In my case, my parents knew that I am gay right from when I was in school.”
