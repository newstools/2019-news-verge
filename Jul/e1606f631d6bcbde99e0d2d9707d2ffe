The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has advised corps members posted to Anambra to settle down, learn and imbibe the ways and culture of the people they have been posted to serve.  Mrs Nnenna Ukonu, Director, Corps Mobilisation, NYSC Headquarters Abuja, gave the advice while addressing the 2019 Batch B corps members at their Umunya Temporary Orientation Camp on Thursday. Ukonu described Anambra as a peaceful state, populated by people with high entrepreneurial spirit the corps members could also learn from. She said rather than lobby to be posted out of Anambra, the corps members should settle down and study the secret of the people’s success. Ukonu said they should not “lobby away their destinies by trying to relocate from the state” based on unsubstantiated claims. The official said many people had missed their luck by working their way out of their God-ordained place of destiny. She also warned the corps members against incessant, unnecessary and unauthorised journeys, to avert the inherent dangers. Ukonu urged them to avail themselves of the different information technologies to reach out to their parents and loved ones. She encouraged them to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the NYSC skills acquisition programme to upgrade themselves toward self reliance at the end of their service year. In his remark, Mr Kehinde Aremu, Coordinator of the NYSC in Anambra, lauded the conduct of the corps members on camp. Aremu said a total of 2,220 corps members were undergoing the orientation course in Anambra, comprising 1080 male and 1140 female.
