The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) on Wednesday said road accidents in Anambra reduced by 30 per cent in six months and attributed the reduction to adequate media reportage of its activities.  The Anambra Sector Commander, Mr Andrew Kumapayi, stated this in Awka during an award ceremony to appreciate and honour some journalists for their selfless services in the propagation of safety information. Kumapayi said the media were crucial to the success of achieving the strategic goals and mandate of the Commission and called for their continued support. “The traffic environment has greatly improved in Anambra. I can say to you that from our records, traffic crashes have reduced by about 30 per cent in the last six months compared to the same period in previous year. “I want to say that the media contributed to this reduction and want to ask you to continue to support us because road safety is a shared responsibility,” he said. Kumapayi thanked the media for supporting the command especially since he assumed duty in Anambra earlier this year. Responding, Mr Emmanuel Ifesinachi, Chairman of Nigeria Union of Journalists, Anambra council, thanked the sector commander for appreciating the role of journalists and recognising some of its members for the award. Ifesinachi also commended the sector commander for the continuous efforts in ensuring safety on the roads in the state. He promised that the media would continue to enlightenment the public on policies and programmes of the commission. It was reported that one of its staff, Mr Chimezie Anaso, received an award for effective reportage of Road Safety tips.
