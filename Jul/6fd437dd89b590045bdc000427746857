The Deputy President of the Senate, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege has commiserated with the government and people of Delta over a recent building collapse which claimed four lives.  Omo-Agege disclosed this in a statement issued by his media office in Abuja on Sunday. A three-storey building nearing completion collapsed in Abraka, Ethiope East Local Government of the state, during a heavy downpour on Saturday.
