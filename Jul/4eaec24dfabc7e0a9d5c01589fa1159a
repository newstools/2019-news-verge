Teach your children to say SORRY to one another when they fight. Teach them to make up when they hurt themselves. Teach them to hug themselves each time they settle. They may not always want to hug, but lovingly teach them to do this, and they will get used to doing it. How a child behaves to others sometimes starts from how they relate with their own siblings. A child who knows how to say sorry at every given time will never find it difficult to apologize to others when there is an issue. SORRY as simple as it seems is never easy to say. Meaning it from our hearts is something very difficult to do, because we were not used to doing these things. It is not really our fault, we grew up this way. It used to be a very hard thing for me to do before but until recently, l made up my mind to always apologize, whether l am right or wrong. I realized that saying sorry doesn’t seize my breath, it doesn’t bleach my skin, acnes won’t break out when l say sorry, l won’t add weight nor lose weight. Saying sorry won’t remove the 200 naira l kept in my purse, neither will it make me choke to death. My daughters say sorry to themselves when they offend each other, they hug themselves and say “I love you” when they make up. This wasn’t easy at first, but gradually, they learnt it. They will hence relate this way to friends and help them in relating with others. I apologize to my children too when l wrong them or scream at them, they are also human beings, they have emotions, they also have ego… Whenever you over react towards them, apologize too. You are teaching them. You are their model, they learn more from you. Whatever it takes to raise a sane generation, please do.
