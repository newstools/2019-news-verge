Mr Germaine Sanwoolu, the Senior Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Diaspora and Foreign Relations, has urged Nigerians in Diaspora not to just invest money, but also ideas to develop Nigeria.  Sanwoolu made this call in an interview with our reporter, on the sidelines of the 2019 National Diaspora Day in Abuja. “It is an opportunity for Nigerians in Diaspora to come to Lagos in particular to invest not only money but also their ideas. “In a city that is the fifth largest economy in Africa; promising and bursting with opportunities, people and dynamism. “Diasporans, who have great ideas for businesses, who want to invest in local businesses and who also have ideas on how we can make Lagos better, have this opportunity to come right now and make Lagos succeed,” he said. The governor’s aide said Lagos State offers an environment conducive for investors, which promises economic growth and development. He added that with its multi-ethnic and multi-cultural environment, the state is welcoming interested Diasporans. He further said that though there were some challenges in the country with regards to security, however, there is relative peace and security in Lagos. “It’s time for them to come; there may be some areas that may not be friendly but Lagos State is actually friendly for Diasporans inclusion, investment and opportunities,” Sanwoolu said.
