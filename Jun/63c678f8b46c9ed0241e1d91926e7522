Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia has charged Mr Chris Ezem, the new Secretary to the State Government (SSG) to adopt the principle of diligence and commitment in his line of duty.  Ikpeazu gave the charge while inaugurating the SSG at the Government House, Umuahia, adding that diligence and commitment were essential to achieving success. He urged him to  bring his wealth of experience to bear in the discharge of his duties. He said: “Your appointment as SSG is a result of painstaking search, which dovetails from your precedents as an experienced lawyer. “As you function, you remain the identity and ambassador of Abia. “The job is not easy and I believe you will rise to the responsibility. You are going to play a major role in coordinating the activities of the state government. “We expect that you will do so being firm and resolute. I am sure that you will not disappoint the people of Abia.”
Responding, Ezem promised that he would focus on the development agenda of the state government in order to promote socio-economic development in Abia. He further promised to evolve ideas that would add value to the programmes and policies of the state government designed to improve the wellbeing of the people.
