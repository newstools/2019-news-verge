Mr. Justice Walter Onnoghen, GCON, as Chief Justice of Nigeria by President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR. “The President’s acceptance of the retirement is in line with Council’s recommendation to the President on 3rd April, 2019. “Council at the end of its deliberations, thanked the President for the acceptance which was in the best interest of Nigeria,’’ Oye said.
