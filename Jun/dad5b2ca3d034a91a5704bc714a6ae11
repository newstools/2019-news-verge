The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) on Wednesday urged motorists to drive with caution as Eid-el-Fitri celebration continues so as to guard against road accidents.  The FRSC Sector Commander in Enugu State, Mr Ogbonna Kalu, gave the advice while speaking with our reporter in Enugu. Kalu, however, called on motorists to shun speeding and wrong overtaking as well as over loading as they put undue pressure on vehicles, especially the tyres. According to the commander, what matters is for the motorists to ensure that they arrive at their destinations in peace and not how fast the journey is. He enjoined the general public, especially Muslims, to observe the Eid el-Fitri with strict adherence to road traffic rules and regulations. “Avoid dangerous driving, overloading, speed violation and making call or texting while driving. “FRSC in Enugu State has deployed sufficient number of personnel and logistics along all highways, crash and congestion-prone areas across the state to ensure smooth celebration,” he said. It was reported that FRSC Enugu has deployed 12 patrol vehicles, two ambulances, two tow trucks and 450 personnel, including special marshals, along designated routes in the state to ensure sanity on the roads during the celebration.
