The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has begun an intensive re-assessment of runways at the nation’s airports to enhance safety.  A statement signed by Mrs Yakubu Henrietta, General Manager of Corporate Affairs of the organisation on Wednesday said the move was to improve on the efficiency of facilities to forestall potential accidents on runways. “Although, regular friction measurement for Port Harcourt International Airport was conducted in March 2019 and result falls within minimum friction coefficient level, the facility witnessed a skidding incident recently. “It is therefore with intention to increase friction coefficient levels of our runways in accordance with Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) advisory circular that the Authority is embarking on this exercise across the nation’s airports. “Moreso that the rain is becoming very heavy and unpredictable,“ she said. Henrietta said the authority had just carried out a de-rubberization exercise from June 15, to June 22, to remove any contaminant as a short term measure to increase the safety of the Port Harcourt runway. She expressed the committed of FAAN to its core values of safety, security and comfort.
