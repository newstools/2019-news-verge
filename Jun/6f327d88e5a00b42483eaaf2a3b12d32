The establishment of Private Universities in Nigeria has been on the rise for over eighteen years and it seems the institutions have come to stay. Currently, there are quite a number of private Universities in Nigeria owned by individuals, organizations, business owners, entrepreneurs, religious bodies across the country. Most parents and Guardians who can afford the payment would prefer the option of a private University because the standard of acceptance is lenient compared to secular or public Universities in terms of admission. Private Universities across the country are gradually taking over from the best public Universities because of the intense work they have put into their developments and one can be rest assured of a very smooth academic calendar. It is a known fact that Private Universities in this part of the world are way more expensive to attend compared to public or secular schools. But the advantage of gaining admission into a private university is that you can actually predict a graduation date right from the beginning because private institutions do not go on strike. To a lot of people, the only disadvantage of gaining admission into a private institution is the exorbitant fees and charges which is not affordable to most parents and guardians but the good news is that most of the private Universities had to come up with a system in which payment of fees and charges will be less of stress to parents and guardians. The fees and charges can be paid in installments (three installments) compared to the past where fees were to be paid in full.
