On the security challenges, Okowa said that strong a statement from the Presidency would help to address the issues. According to him, the presidency has arranged a meeting with the state governors on Friday and I hope that the issue of insecurity will be at the front burner. “It is unfortunate where we have found ourselves as a nation in terms of insecurity but I hope that a strong decision from the presidency will help to address the menace. “The security agencies have little to do but I am hopeful that at the end of Friday meeting the president will make strong statement that will cause the security agencies to work with state governments to achieve desired result,” he said. Okowa, however, said that his administration would also partner local vigilance groups to boost security across the state.
