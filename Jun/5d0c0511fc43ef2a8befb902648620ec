Olushola Ogunnowo, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Nationwide League One (NLO), says the Super Falcons have impressed so far with their performance at the ongoing 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup.  Ogunnowo told our correspondent on Tuesday in Abuja that the team would only need to be more focused if they eventually advance to the Round of 16. It was reported that the Nigerian senior national female football at the ongoing 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France are still waiting to know their fate. The team which finished third in Group A of the competition’s first round may not know their opponents until the end of all first round matches on Thursday. Ogunnowo, who commended the Falcons in spite their loss to France in their last group match, pointed out that the team had performed brilliantly so far. “Everybody saw the good work they did in Monday’s match. They gave their opponents a tough time in the game, even though France players were having more possession of the ball. “The Falcons really fought well in the game. We should be grateful to our goalkeeper, Chiamaka Nnadozie, for the great work she did and to the entire team for the work well done. “All in all, it was a good match. France were able to score the only goal through a penalty kick, and this was through a technical hitch. “We all know that France are among the best football teams in the world, and they wanted to win the game at all costs,’’ he said. Ogunnowo however urged the Falcons to be more focused as they go on, and in the event of their qualification. “They need to continue with the same spirit shown in their last match, so that they will finish in a good position at the end of the World Cup,’’ he said. It was reported that the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup will end on July 7.
