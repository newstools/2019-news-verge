President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday, accented to the N30,000 new National Minimum Wage Bill as approved by the two chambers of the National Assembly. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly (Senate), Sen. Ita Enang, confirmed this development when he briefed State House correspondents in Abuja on Thursday. President Buhari had in January sought the approval of N27,000 as against the N30,000 agreed upon by stakeholders.
However, the Senate and the House of Representatives approved the sum of N30,000 as the new national minimum wage. Enang stated that signing of the new minimum wage by the president had made compulsory by employers of labour to pay the N30,000 as minimum wage.
