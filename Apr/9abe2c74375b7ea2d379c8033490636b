The United States government on Friday sanctioned two companies, Ballito Bay Shipping Inc. and ProPer in Management Inc., operating in Venezuela’s oil sector and the vessel Despina Andrianna used to transport oil to Cuba. The Department of State in a statement to NEWSVERGE Newspaper said that additional vessels, in which Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA has interests, are being identified as blocked property, pursuant to Executive Order 13850. These actions according to the authority target entities and vessels that have been enabling the former Maduro regime to continue undermine the prosperity and democracy that Venezuelans deserve. The former Maduro regime continues to line its pockets with the profits from natural resources that properly belong to the people of Venezuela. Meanwhile, Cuba is propping up the former regime and facilitating its repression of the Venezuelan people, through its military and intelligence support to Maduro. “The United States is taking action to curtail this and other ongoing corrupt activities of Nicolas Maduro and malign actors. We encourage companies, banks, and other institutions to refrain from providing services that support his repressive practices. “We also urge countries to take appropriate legal measures to deprive Maduro and his cronies of assets held overseas and to prevent travel to their countries. “We will continue to use the full weight of U.S. economic and diplomatic power to complete the peaceful transition to a once-again free, prosperous and stable Venezuela.” Said the Department of State.
