Sen. Kolawole Balogun (PDP-Oyo South) has described his victory at the Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Ibadan as a renewed hope for the common man.  Balogun said this on Tuesday while addressing newsmen at his campaign office in Ibadan shortly after the tribunal had upheld his election. Recall that Balogun had defeated former Gov. Abiola Ajimobi of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Oyo South Senatorial District election held on Feb. 23. It was reported that Ajimobi had dragged Balogun to the election petitions tribunal to challenge his victory at the poll. “It was an erudite judgment. The judgment was delivered in the interest of the masses. It was delivered fearlessly and it gave a renewed hope to the common man. “That shows that in this country, there is still hope for the common man and that all hope is not lost,” Balogun said. He described the judgment as a victory for democracy, the people of his senatorial district, Oyo State and Nigeria, in general. “As you all know, the election was revolution. It was a vote against lawlessness, executive arrogance and against a government that lacked regard for every norm of good governance,” he said.
