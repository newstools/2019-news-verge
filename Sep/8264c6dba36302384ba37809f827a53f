Gov. Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has flagged off the construction of feeder rural roads across the state.  Speaking at one of the ceremonies on Monday in Agwade Community of Obi Local Government Area (LGA), the governor said that his administration would open up rural communities to boost trade and agriculture activities. He explained that the flag-off of the 22 km road, which would lead to Shupe and Tabula communities of Obi LGA, was in fulfilment of his promise to open up rural communities within his first 100-days in office. He said that the rural roads which would be grade-c, would be constructed through direct labour and cost N330 million. The governor added that very soon similar construction of rural roads would be done in other communities across the three Senatorial Zones of the state. He, therefore, called on engineers from the state ministry of works handling the rural roads to do quality work, to justify the government’s confidence in them. “This first rural road is a litmus test, so do quality work to enable you compete with contractors and other companies,” the governor added. Gov. Sule, therefore, called on the engineers to adhere to contract specification and deliver within the stipulated period. In his goodwill message, Mohammed Eyimoga, Chairman of Obi commended the governor for the project and promised that if completed, it would boost trade and agriculture activities in the area.
