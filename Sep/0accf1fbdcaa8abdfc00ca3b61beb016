Sen. Shehu Sani has condemned attacks on Nigerians living in South Africa, saying such must be considered as a crime against humanity.  Sani said this at a public symposium organised by the Democratic Socialist Movement on Thursday in Abuja. The theme of the symposium was: “Nigeria Still in Crisis 10 years after Chief  Gani Fawehinmi’s Death. Any Hope for the Working Masses?” Sani said that efforts of those who fought for South Africa’s liberation must not be in vain. He, however, warned that Nigerians must desist from reprisal attacks on South Africans living in Nigeria and their businesses. “Nigerian must not unleash violence against anybody, we should be on a higher moral ground,” he said. Sani said the attack by South African on Nigerians and other African countries was like spitting on the graves of African leaders who fought for their liberation. He said that attacking South Africans would amount to taking  laws into our hands. He called on the African Union to find a lasting solution to attacks being perpetrated by South Africans against other Africans, stressing that the AU must initiate a new convention that all Africa must signed to. According to him, the convention must protect Africans staying in any part of the continent. Sani said it amounted to ingratitude for a selected few in South Africa to turn against Nigerians who laboured for the country to free it from apartheid. “I do not share the view that all South Africans are bad,” he said.
