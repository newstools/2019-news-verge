The Labour Party (LP) on Wednesday expressed confidence that the party would win the Nov. 16 governorship election in Kogi.  The party National Chairman Abdukadir Abdulsalam told our reporter in Abuja that the chances of the party winning was bright. He said his optimism followed the fact that the party was presenting a female candidate, Mrs Harirat Yakubu. Abdulsalam said that Yakubu emerged following the primary election held in Lokoja as unprecedented, experienced politician and popular political activist. The national chairman said that aside the fact that Yakubu was a very popular female politician, there were other factors that would work in favour of the party in the election. “We are sure that we will make a different in Kogi. People no longer tolerate Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) or All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kogi. “Workers in Kogi have not being paid salaries for months. Pensioners who served the state with their lives were not also being paid. “Our chances is that our candidate is a very noticeable woman and experienced politician. She has labour background and working experience. “She is going to contest with the incumbent who the residents believed not to have performed; so, it is going to be easy for us,’’ he said. Abdulsalam said that the party was prepared to embark on grassroots and issue based campaign in the state. “We are going to roll out our campaign which is going to be community by community and house to house. “We are going to focus on the grassroots. We are going to show the people that the incumbent and previous government have failed to perform,” he said. Abdulsalam, however, urged registered voters in the state to collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and come out to exercise their voting rights on the election day.
