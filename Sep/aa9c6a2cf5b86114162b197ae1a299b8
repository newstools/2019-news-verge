The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has commended the Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal’s judgment upholding the victory of Gov. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State.  The party gave the commendation in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbindiyan, on Monday, in Abuja. Ologbindiyan described the judgment as victory for democracy and justice for the people of the state who gave Makinde their mandate at the March 9 governorship election. He said that the jubilant atmosphere across the state over the verdict was a clear testimony that the judgment had fulfilled the desires and expectations of the people. “The people of Oyo State were particularly overjoyed with the judgment because of Gov Makinde’s demonstrated capacity and commitment to deliver good governance in all sectors of life in the state,” he said. While congratulating the governor and the people of the state on behalf of the party, Ologbindiyan urged Makinde not to relent in his efforts to turn around the fortunes of the people. He also commended the members of the tribunal for their courage in delivering justice to the people of the state.
