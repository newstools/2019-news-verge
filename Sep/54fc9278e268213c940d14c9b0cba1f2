New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday abandoned his long-shot campaign to win the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination. According to the Mayor, “I feel like I’ve contributed all I can to this primary election,” he said on the show. “And it’s clearly not my time. So I’m going to end my presidential campaign.” De Blasio was one of three mayors running for the Democratic nomination. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam remain in the race. His withdrawal from the race came after months of failing to improve what was persistently ultra-low support in opinion polls tracking voters’ preferences for Democratic contenders vying for the nomination. Recent national polls show de Blasio receiving, at best, support from just 1% of the respondents. He failed to qualify for the third Democratic debate, which took place last week. A Siena College Research Institute poll in early September found that less than 1% of New York state voters supported his candidacy and 0% of voters in his hometown of New York City did so. A month before he announced his run in May, with a message that President “Donald Trump must be stopped,” a majority of voters in New York City had a negative opinion about de Blasio’s performance as mayor. And a large majority of city residents — 76% — had said he should not run for president. “The odds are clearly against me,” de Blasio said earlier in September. “But the odds have been against me in every election I’ve been in, and I’ve managed to prevail.”
