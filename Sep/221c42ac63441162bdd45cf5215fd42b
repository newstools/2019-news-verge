The Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, has cautioned corps members against the use of social media to promote disunity in Nigeria.  Shuaibu gave the advice when he visited NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp, Emure-Ekiti on Thursday during the ongoing Batch B Stream 11 orientation course. According to him, rather than promoting division among the different ethnic groups, the corps members should be ambassadors of national development. “Corps members should tread with caution. The social media should not be used to propagate disunity in the country. “Do not be an evangelist of hate speech, rather be ready to render selfless service for national development and transformation, Shuaibu advised. The director-general urged corps members, particularly the current set in camp, to contribute meaningfully to their host communities in their places of primary assignment. “Identify the challenges facing your host communities, see opportunities in them, source for ways to leave the place better than you met it,” he said. Ibrahim decried the spate of road accidents involving corps members, warning them against unauthorised journeys. “In recent times, corps members have been involved in motor accidents, therefore, it is mandatory to take permission from the appropriate authorities before embarking on any journey. “Henceforth, all the keys to the buses (vehicles) of the religious bodies, NCCF, NACC, and MCAN shall be in the care of the State Coordinator and approval sought before their usage,” he  said. The NYSC boss said that corps members, as nation builders, must refrain from all forms of criminal activities, such as cyber-crime, robbery, sexual harassment and other social vices. The director general later took a tour of facilities in the camp in company of the State Coordinator, Mrs Emmanuella Okpongete, and other NYSC officials.
