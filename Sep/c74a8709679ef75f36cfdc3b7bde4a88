MTN sales outlets across Lagos State remained shut following attacks by hoodlums on Tuesday while reacting to xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and nationals of other nations in South Africa.  Our correspondent who visited some outlets in Lagos, reports that the shops were deserted with few people clearing and carrying out repairs as a result of damage by the hoodlums. An MTN officer who spoke to NAN on condition of anonymity said the decision to lock up the outlet was to prevent further attacks on South African companies. Some customers at the Surulere sales outlets expressed, however, mixed feelings on the attack and damage on MTN offices. Kunle Adigun, a banker, said the attack on MTN outlets was not the solution to the xenophobia going on in South Africa. “We sincerely do not support xenophobic attacks on our brothers in South Africa but this is not the best solution. “Unfortunately, most property destroyed in South Africa belong to Nigerians, Nigerian government should take strong actions against that country,” he said. Juliet James, a subscriber of the mobile network, expressed dismay about the way Nigerians were being treated in South Africa. “I am very upset about the treatment lashed on Nigerians in South Africa, it is high time our government took action and because of this, I have decided to stop using MTN. “I am porting to a Nigerian service provider; I have broken my sim and will not have any business with anything from South Africa,” she said. It was reported that MTN conveyed the information to the public via text messages on Wednesday, that its offices remained shut to all of its customers in the country. The company, however, gave an option for customers to reach MTN via Twitter, MtNonline.com, chat or call centre by dialing 180.
