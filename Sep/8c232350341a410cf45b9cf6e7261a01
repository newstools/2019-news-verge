Chelsea FC on Saturday cruised to first home Premier League win after goals from Jorginho and Willian sealed a 2-0 victory against Brighton. Lampard had presided over two draws and a defeat in the league at Stamford Bridge since the Blues legend was hired from Derby in the close-season. A League Cup thrashing of minnows Grimsby in midweek was Lampard’s only win on home turf until Jorginho’s second-half penalty broke Brighton’s resistance. Willian bagged the second goal to guarantee Chelsea that avoided failing to win their opening four home league matches for the first time since 1986-87. Chelsea’s third league win this season was just reward for a dominant display that backed Lampard’s belief his raw team can challenge for a top-four finish. Giving further encouragement to Lampard, the Blues kept a clean sheet for the first time in 10 games in all competitions this term. Brighton have now lost all nine league meetings with Chelsea, setting a new Football League record for most games played against one opponent with a 100 per cent losing record. Graham Potter’s team are winless in six league matches and sit just above the relegation zone. Chelsea were without N’Golo Kante after he complained of a hamstring niggle following training on Friday, but the France midfielder wasn’t missed in this one-sided encounter.
