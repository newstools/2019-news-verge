Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa says civil servants working with the state government would soon be able to own houses they can afford being constructed in the state.  Fintiri gave the assurance during a ground breaking ceremony of the construction of 2,000 housing units in Yola on Monday. He said that construction of the houses was part of the fulfilment of promises made during the electioneering campaign. ”The 2,,000 housing units are  mainly for civil servants, to enable them own houses at affordable cost,” Fintiri said. He said that 1,400 housing units would be built in Yola, 200 in Mubi and the remaining 400 spread across the state. Speaking earlier, Mrs Jummai Barkindo, Permanent Secretary, state ministry of Housing and Urban Development, said that the project was to ease accommodation problems in the state, especially among civil servants. Mr Femi Adewale, representative of the construction firm, Family Homes Fund Limited, said that the housing units would consist of two and three bedrooms. Adewale said that the construction period was 12 months from the day of ground breaking. He said that the company, if given the opportunity, was willing to construct additional 2,000 housing units.
