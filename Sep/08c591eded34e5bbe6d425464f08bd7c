Following the recent xenophobic attack on some  Nigerians and their properties in South Africa, some irate Nigerian youths on Tuesday took to the streets in Surulere Local Government Area, Lagos State, to protest against the act.  It was reported that the irate youths allegedly threatened to attack South African-owned businesses such as MTN, Shoprite malls, Multi-choice among others in Lagos. Our correspondent observed that Shoprite mall located on Adeniran Ogunsanya Street and MTN located on Bode Thomas, Surulere had to close early for business following the protest by the angry youth. It was reported that the youth who were mainly males expressed their displeasure at the way South Africans were attacking Nigerians in their country. They called on the Federal Government to take proactive diplomatic actions that would stop how most Nigerians were being maltreated in South Africa. One of the protesters said “enough is enough” adding that it was high time that President Muhammadu Buhari did something about the situation before they (youths) take the law into their own hands. One of the MTN officials who begged  for anonymity said that they opened at 8 a.m., today just like any other day until he got a call saying that the neighbouring mall: Shoprite, was under attack and that they (MTN) should close shop as soon as possible. “We were scared and that led us to shut down the premises around 2 p.m., and asked all our staff to go home,” he said. One of the police officials from the Surulere Police Division who refused to disclose his name said that everything was under control, adding that they were there to enforce law and order. Our correspondent observed that several police vehicles were parked in front of Shoprite mall while the uniformed men were pacifying the irate youths. Our correspondent also noticed that the irate youths did not disturb the activities going on inside Leisure Mall which is the neighbouring shopping mall to Shoprite in Surulere.
