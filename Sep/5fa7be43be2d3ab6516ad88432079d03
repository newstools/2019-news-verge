The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says it is not engaged in recruiting or replacing of staff, Mr Bisi Kazeem, Corps’ Public Education Officer, said on Wednesday.  He said that a link circulated online that the corps is carrying out another recruitment and replacement exercise ”is totally false”. It was reported that the Corps recently concluded training of its personnel who had been commissioned and deployed to various formations across the states and the FCT. Kazeem warned the public to desist from patronising such online fraudsters who are bent on duping unsuspecting Nigerians. “Members of the public will be duly informed immediately the corps commences recruitment into its services through appropriate media platforms including its social media handles.”
