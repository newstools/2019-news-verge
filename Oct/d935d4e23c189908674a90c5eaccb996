The Forum of All Progressives Congress (APC) Local Government Chairmen in Zamfara says that the party remains intact in spite of a “defection’’ report.  The forum observes that a media report has said that some members of APC have “defected’’ to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. The Forum Chairman, Alhaji Tapa Nasarawa, stated this in Gusau at the monthly stakeholders meeting at state party’s secretariat on Tuesday. Nasarawa, who is the APC Chairman, Bukkuyum Local Government Area, said that although the party was not in control of the leadership of the state, the party retained its strength as the strongest in the state. “As leaders of the party at grassroots, we are enjoying support and cooperation from our members even though our party is not in power at state level. “You know APC is a party of common men, people of this state enjoyed meaningful development projects across all sectors executed by the immediate past APC-led administration in the state. “That is why people of the state, especially in rural communities are still behind the APC leader in the state, Alhaji Abdul’aziz Yari,’’ he said. In his remark, the APC Chairman, Maradun Local Government Area, Alhaji Sa’adu Gora, said that the report of massive “defection’’ of party members from the area was not true. Similarly, the State Chairman of the party, Alhaji Lawal Liman, thanked party members for their continued support and cooperation with APC leadership in the state. He urged party leaders at local government and wards levels to always cooperate and get familiar with their members.
