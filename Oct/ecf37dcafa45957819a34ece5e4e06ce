Chelsea FC on Saturday extended their winning run to five matches in all competitions courtesy of Marcos Alonso’s strike against Newcastle United. Marcos Alonso’s strike was enough to secure the three points on a day where quality finishing in the final third was an issue for both teams. The Blues exposed the visitors down the right before Callum Hudson-Odoi teed up Alonso, who struck his drive through Martin Dubravka to find the back of the net. Newcastle did not offer a great deal, although Ciaran Clark headed a late attempt over the bar from close range. Steve Bruce’s men remain in trouble, dropping back into the relegation zone following their defeat. Meanwhile, Chelsea is next in action during the week against Ajax on the road in the Champions League, while Newcastle face Wolves next Sunday at St James’ Park in the Premier League.
