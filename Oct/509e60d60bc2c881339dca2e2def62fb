NEWSVERGE reports that the Nigerian Minister of Finance, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, recently in Washington D.C. said that the Federal Government’s request for a World Bank loan to finance the power sector was at the verge of being granted. The Minister who was briefing journalist on activities of the Nigerian delegation to the just-concluded annual meetings of the World Bank/International Monetary Fund Annual Meetings explained that the Nigerian Government had put a request for financing of the power sector at a range of $1.5 billion to $4 billion. Mrs Zainab Ahmed, also said that the loan would be used to plug funding gaps and tariff differentials, which she said private investors in the sector had always complained about. She said a portion of the money would go into the transmission segment of the electricity value chain. If the government is able to expand the facility to four billion dollars, the additional one billion would be used for the distribution segment, according to her.
