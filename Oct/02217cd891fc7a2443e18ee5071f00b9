The Ido-Osi Local Government area on Friday charged all artisans, businessmen and women in the communities within council to pay their taxes.  The Coordinating Director of Local Government, Mr Adeola Williams, said this in an interview with our reporter in Ido-Osi. He said that the council was working hard to ensure that roads, markets and other basic amenities were provided for the people inspite of paucity of funds. Williams charged the businessmen and women as well as artisans in the local government to pay their taxes regularly and obtain their receipts for verification. He noted that the council had re-roofed the ‎market stalls in Ifaki and Aiyetoro-Ekiti to further boost the Internal Generated Revenue (IGR) of the local government council. “The roof of the market stalls in Ifaki and Aiyetoro-Ekiti have been damaged for a while, so the council decided to re-roof the stalls to increase our IGR. “We have equally started evacuating sand that blocked the drains and caused erosion to destroy major roads in Ora-Ekiti. “The council was able to carry out these few projects with the little resources that we were able to generate but as soon as we have more funds, other outstanding projects will be executed. “I want to appeal to our people especially the artisans to pay their taxes, to enable the local government have adequate financial strength to carry out more development projects,” he said.
