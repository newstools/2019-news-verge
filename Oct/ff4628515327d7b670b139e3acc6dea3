Simon Lalong of Plateau has congratulated his Benue counterpart, Samuel Ortom, on his victory at the polls and the revalidation of the mandate by the Benue Governorship Elections Petitions Tribunal.  Lalong made the congratulation on Monday at the 2019 Jos International Trade Fair and at which Benue was represented by the state’s Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Trade and Commerce, Mrs Helen Angwe. “I wish to congratulate my brother, Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue, on his victory at the general election and verdict of the elections petitions tribunal. “The presence of Benue delegation is a testament of the cordial relationship between the two states. “I hope that the in next year’s trade fair we will have Benue yam competing with Plateau yam here,” he said. Angwe in her solidarity message, said that the relationship between Benue and Plateau had reached a family affair. The permanent secretary said that Plateau’s yearly presence at Benue Trade Fairs was remarkable and thanked the Plateau Government for making it possible. “If we are to reciprocate every person in Benue would have been here but because of certain challenges our good intentions of attending your previous trade fairs were truncated. “However, I want to assure that our presence at this very trade fair is to lubricate our relationship with you and plan better for the next one,” she said. She said that apart from being the ‘Food Basket of the Nation’, Benue is endowed with natural resources and highly intelligent manpower to explore. According to Angwe, there was abundant coal, kaolin and limestone in the state waiting for investors to explore.
