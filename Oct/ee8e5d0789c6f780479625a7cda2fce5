Draft Ministerial Press Briefing note on the Outcome of the 2019 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group in Washington DC, United States. Good Morning Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen of the Press. It is my privilege to address you this morning on the outcome of the 2019 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group.  The major highlights of the discussions in the various meetings are as follows:  Global Economy Since the last meeting in April, the global economy has experienced a synchronized slowdown with growth weaker than expected in about 90 countries. Growth is projected to slow down from 3.6 percent in 2018 to 3.0 per cent in 2019. This is the weakest over the last decade.  Main triggers of the global slow down includes; the trade tensions leading to the disruption of global value chains, entrenched policy uncertainty, rising debt concerns, looming crisis in Brexit and adverse geopolitical developments. We therefore called for continued momentum from trade truce to trade peace that will enhance macroeconomic stability;           Bilateral Meetings:                Technical Assistance from the Bank  to implementing agencies such as NERC on PIP Review, business continuity regulations, and TA to the Federal Ministry of Finance to help in the assessment of Contingent Liabilities in the power sector and options for dealing with them;            Financing of between US$1.5 billion to US$4 billion for the Power Sector.  The World Bank indicated its readiness to provide the TA in the near-term and the funding in a programmatic manner.   I have other important meetings lined up later today with the President of the World Bank Group – David Malpass, Managing Director of the IMF – Kristalina Georgieva and the Meetings of the Africa Caucus with the Heads of the two Bretton Woods Institutions. I will stop here and call on the CBN Governor for his own intervention.  Thank you.  Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed FEDERAL MINISTRY OF FINANCE NIGERIA October 20, 2019
