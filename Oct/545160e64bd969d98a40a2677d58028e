A Chief Magistrates’ Court sitting in Kano on Tuesday ordered the remand of a 36-year-old lecturer, Ali Shehu, in prison custody for breach of trust and sexually harassing his female student.  The accused, a lecturer of Kano State School of Technology, is facing trial on a two-count charge of breach of official trust and attempt to commit an offence, contrary to Sections 95 and 98 of the Penal Code. Chief Magistrate Muhammad Idris ordered the remand of the accused person and adjourned the matter until Oct. 15, for sentence.
