Activities on the nation’s bourse remained on a negative posture on Thursday with the market capitalisation dropping further by N111 billion, amid sell pressure in blue chips.  It was reported that the market capitalization which opened at N13.296 trillion shed N111 billion to close at N13.185 trillion. In the same vein, the All Share Index (ASI) decreased by 229.18 points or 0.84 per cent to close at 27,085.69. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Nestle Nigeria, Beta Glass, Unilever Nigeria, Guinness Nigeria and Dangote Sugar Refinery. The Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., Mr Ambrose Omordion, said he expected the trend to continue due to profit-taking. Omordion also said that bargain hunters were taking advantage of low stock prices to position ahead quarterly financials. “Discerning investors should latch onto it as a way of averaging down and recouping their investment immediately a recovery stage sets in,” he said. Market breadth closed negative with 12 gainers compared with 18 losers. Nestle one of the highly capitalised equities on the exchange led the losers’ chart in percentage terms, dropping 9.99 per cent to close at N1, 255.50 per share.
