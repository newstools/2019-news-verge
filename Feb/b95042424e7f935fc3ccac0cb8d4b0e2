Dr Matau Bernard-Malau, the Returning Officer, Plateau Central Senatorial District, on Monday night declared the National Assembly election in Kanam Local Government Area inconclusive.  Addressing Party agents, observers and INEC officials at the Pankshin Collation Centre, the returning officer, said that the decision became imperative due to the problems encountered while receiving the results from the area. “We have various issues raised with the NASS result from Kanam; I believe this is the best option. “INEC will decide what to do after receiving our reports on the results brought to us by the Collection Officer, Dr One Idowu,” Bernard-Malau said. After the announcement, the returning officer packed his things to go when he was forced to put it down in writing for all agents to sign. Bernard-Malau thereafter, directed his colleague, his colleague, Dr Joseph Mangut, Returning Officer for the House of Representatives election, to put up the write up, which he signed and gave to the agents as a proof.
