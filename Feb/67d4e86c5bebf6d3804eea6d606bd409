According to him, Nigeria’s Excess Crude Account (ECA) currently stands at 249 billion dollars. A communique issued at the end of the meeting noted that in January, the federation crude oil sales increased by 2.4 million barrels, resulting in increased federation revenue by 149.94 million dollars, in spite of a drop in price of crude oil from 81.06 dollars to 75 dollars per barrel.
