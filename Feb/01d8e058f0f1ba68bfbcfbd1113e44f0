Spanish La Liga’s organising body says it does not expect its President, Javier Tebas, to jump ship to the English Premier League (EPL).  The declaration was in response to British media reports that the Spaniard has emerged as a candidate to become the English top-flight’s chief executive. “We are not aware of this supposed interest. “That said, if a competition as important as the EPL is taking note of the work being done by La Liga, including its president, clubs and employees, it is a source of pride for the entire organisation,” a La Liga spokesman said on Wednesday. “Javier has a contract with La Liga and not only is he happy here, he also has responsibilities and challenges which occupy his full attention. “This includes the changing broadcast landscape and battling the threat of new competitions — including format changes that put domestic leagues at risk.” The EPL has struggled to find a successor to long-serving chief executive Richard Scudamore, who stepped down last December after 19 years with the organisation. Susanna Dinnage, a senior executive at media organisation Discovery, was named as the new chief executive last November but later announced she would not be taking up the role. The 56-year-old Tebas made headlines by pledging last August to play one La Liga game per season overseas. The bid to stage Girona’s game against FC Barcelona in Miami last month however fell through after Barca withdrew from it, citing a lack of consensus.
