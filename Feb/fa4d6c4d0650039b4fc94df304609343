President Muhammadu Buhari has reiterated the determination of his administration to rid the country of injustice and corruption.  “Any person who cheated or looted the nation will be brought to justice, irrespective of status of the person in society,” he said. The president’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in a statement in Abuja on Monday, said Buhari stated this at an audience with South-West Imams and Islamic scholars on Sunday at the State House, Abuja. The President urged religious leaders in the country to spread the message among their followers of the government’s total determination to promote social justice across the entire society. According to him, the nation’s diverse religions and cultures teach justice by all and for all. “Unless there is justice for everyone, the country cannot progress,’’ he added. The leader of the delegation, Sheik Abdulrasheed Hadiyatullah described politics as the proper administration of public affairs and rebuilding what was destroyed. He commended President Buhari for doing just that, and assured him of support in reforming the country. “We have never seen a purposeful government as this one. We have great respect for you. “We will continue to support your war against corruption and the programmes aimed at making life better for the generality of Nigerians,” Sheik Hadiyatullah declared.
