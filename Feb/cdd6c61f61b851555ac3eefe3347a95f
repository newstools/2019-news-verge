Dr Cyril Omorogbe, INEC, Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Delta, has blamed the delay in commencement of voting in some parts of the state on late arrival of result sheets. The REC who disclosed this to newsmen on Saturday in Asaba, noted that some materials, particularly the result sheets arrived the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Asaba, at about 12 p.m on Friday. He, however, gave the assurance that the process, though starting a bit behind schedule, would be concluded well, as material were being dispatched to respective wards and units across the state. He appealed to the people to be patient as the challenges were being addressed while assuring that he would be visiting the polling centres to feel their pulse. It is worthy of note that electorate arrived at most voting centres ahead of the materials and INEC officials. In Ward 9 unit 3, Okpanam, Oshimili North Local Government Area, voting commenced at about 9.20 a.m. Mr Victor Nwaokobia, the first to vote at the unit, said despite the delay he hoped that the process would go on well. On his part, Chief Patrick Ukah, the state Commissioner for Information who also voted at the unit, said the smart card reader was a bit slow and that INEC officials were trying to master the use. According to him, the challenge was not peculiar to Delta because the issue has been raised in some other states he contacted. “The security men are on ground and they are doing well; nobody is being harassed and as you can see, the voting is going on smoothly,” he said.
