Social Democratic Party (SDP) has called on its members and other electorate to vote en masse on Saturday for its adopted presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).  A factional Chairman of the party, Chief Supo Shonibare, made the call at a news briefing after the faction’s National Working Committee meeting on Wednesday, in Abuja. Shonibare urged the electorate across the country not to be deterred by the postponement of the election but to come out to vote for Abubakar, who would tackle “poverty, unemployment and undemocratic tenets.’’ He said that the adoption of Abubakar by the SDP as its candidate was in consonance with the agreement reached among the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) members, which SDP was part of. “The adoption was premised on the fact that after a careful study and assessment of the leading presidential candidates, plans of Abubakar were closely inter-related to the principles and manifesto of the SDP, particularly regarding restructuring. “We may for the avoidance of doubt, say that SDP also took this position in line with outcry of millions of Nigerians who desire change in our country’s national leadership. “I call on all SDP members and supporters nationwide to come out and vote in their multitudes on election day and vote for SDP candidates standing for elections in all other positions.’’ Shonibare, who expressed displeasure over the postponement of Saturday’s elections, urged Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be impartial and ensure that the rescheduled polls were credible, free, fair and credible. “The SDP strongly urges INEC to engage all critical national and foreign election stakeholders in its pre-election and post-election processes in an open and transparent atmosphere as attestation to its credibility.’’ He also called on security agencies to ensure that they were professional and not engage in intimidation of voters while carrying out their duties on election days.
