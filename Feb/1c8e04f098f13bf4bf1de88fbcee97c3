Karim Benzema scored his sixth goal in four games as Real Madrid beat Alaves 3-0 on Sunday for a fourth successive La Liga victory.  The win took the European champions to within eight points of leaders FC Barcelona. The French striker knocked a cross from Spanish left back Sergio Reguilon into the net from close range on the half hour mark. He broke the deadlock against an organised Alaves side who beat Real Madrid 1-0 earlier in the season at Mendizorrotza. Santiago Solariâ€™s side looked comfortable without hitting top gear. They did not seal the victory until in-form Brazilian Vinicius Jr. tapped into the net in the 80th minute to score his first goal in La Liga. Spain international Alvaro Odriozola had a goal ruled out for offside but substitute Mariano Diaz completed the scoring with a diving header. Real Madrid, the only top-three side in La Liga to win at the weekend, moved on to 42 points, two behind second-placed Atletico Madrid, who lost 1-0 at Real Betis. They are eight points adrift of Barca who drew 2-2 at home to Valencia on Saturday.
