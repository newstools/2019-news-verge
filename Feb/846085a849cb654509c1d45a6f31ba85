Minister of Interior, Lt.-Gen. Abdulrahman Dambazau (rted) has approved a visa fee waiver for accredited election observers and monitors.  Comptroller-General Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Mr Muhammad Babandede announced this in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday. He said that the waiver was sequel to the re-scheduling of the 2019 general elections to Feb. 23 and March 9. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) last week postponed the presidential and governorship elections due to logistics and operational reasons. According to the minister, the gesture was in consideration of the plight of accredited election observers and monitors who are caught-up by the re-scheduled election. He urged all affected individuals and organisations wishing to extend their stay or travel back to their countries and return for the next election to visit NIS Visa Desk at the INEC Headquarters. “The desk officers will attend to those requiring extension of their visa issued Gratis (No Fee Charge). “This provision became necessary to afford those affected the opportunity to travel out or return without violating the immigration provisions that relates to entry and exit with valid visa and document.”
