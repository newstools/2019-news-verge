The Federal Government has promised to render more support for investors and other key players in the nationâ€™s sugar industry to achieve sufficiency in sugar production.  The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr Adeniyi Adebayo made the promise in Abuja on Thursday, while taking briefings from the management of the National Sugar Development Council (NSDC), led by its Executive Secretary, Dr Latif Busari. Adebayo, in a statement signed by his Special Adviser, Mr Wale Ajakaye reiterated the desire of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari to work with all stakeholders in the industry to address all challenges. The minister said that the present administration had done a lot in the area of agriculture and non-oil sectors, stressing that sugar sufficiency would further support such initiatives. He expressed optimism that Nigeria would soon be at par with nations like Brazil and Mauritius, which were presently diversifying into ethanol energy production through modern sugar technology. The minister added that the government would also ensure full implementation of the ten-year national sugar master plan adopted by the Federal Government in 2012. Earlier, Busari in his presentation listed some achievements of the current administration in the industry to include job creation and industrialisation. He said that part of the plan was to create 114,000 jobs and produce 1.7 million tonnes of sugar annually. According to Busari, with reduced importation of sugar and increase in local production, about 350 to 500 million dollars would be saved in foreign exchange. He also listed Dangote Sugar Industry, BUA International Group and Golden Sugar Company as the three major operators in the industry, accounting for about 99.8 per cent of sugar in current use in the country.
