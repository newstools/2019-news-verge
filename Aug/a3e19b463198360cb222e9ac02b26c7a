Access Bank, through its W Initiative has partnered with the Federal Ministry of Women

women in business across Africa on skills required to build sustainable businesses.
The W Initiative is the home of everything Access Bank has to offer women. It is a
brand dedicated to inspiring, connecting and empowering women across every
stage of their lives either as women in business, women and family or young
professionals. The initiative has identified the importance of boosting one’s business while
leveraging technology and digital platforms. Hence, the partnership with the
Federal Ministry of Women Affairs on its 50 Million Women Speak Project with
ECOWAS will boost the economic empowerment of women through the provision of a
capacity building and networking platforms that will provide access to information on
financial and non-financial services. Victor Etuokwu, Executive Director, Retail Banking Division, said “the world at large
has gone global and in a short while, even the most basic things will require digital
expertise. We have gone into this partnership to reiterate Access Bank’s focus on the
women and to help them move with this digital evolution to strengthen their
businesses”, The pioneer program was held in Lagos on the 29 th of July 2019 with more than 100
women in attendance while the subsequent trainings will cut across the six regions in
Nigeria. One of the beneficiaries of the pioneer program and CEO Nanny Academy, Mrs.
Amara Agbim, said, “the program is expository and has provided me with latest
information and skills on how to market my business and expand my reach across
Africa” It is believed that Access Bank’s commitment to empower female entrepreneurs will
continue to contribute immensely to the growth of SME’s in Nigeria and further impact
on the social and economic growth of the nation.
