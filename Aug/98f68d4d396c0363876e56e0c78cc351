Gov. Bello Matawalle of Zamfara has said that construction work on the Gusau Airport project would commence this month.  Matawalle disclosed this on Sunday in Gusau when he received the contractors and consultants that would handle the project.

He advised the contractors handling the project to source their labourers and the building materials locally. “We have the manpower you will need. Our engineers will join your workers so that a qualitative job will be executed in record time,” the governor said. Representatives of both the consulting firm, ULO Consultants Ltd, Mr Uche Oko-ponu, and the project bankers – Heritage Bank – Mr George Oko-obah, in their remarks, said that they were ready and capable of executing the project.
