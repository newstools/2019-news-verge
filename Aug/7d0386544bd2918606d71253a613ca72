Chelsea FC manager, Frank Lampard on Saturday got his first win after three matches with 2 – 3 victory at the home stadium of Norwich city.  Tammy Abraham opened the scoring early on with his first senior goal for Chelsea before Todd Cantwell levelled from close range. Mount put Chelsea back in front but Norwich striker Teemu Pukki grabbed a second equaliser with his fifth goal of the campaign before halftime. Abraham clinched the points in the second half but Chelsea legend Lampard, whose third child was born last year, had no grand plans to celebrate his maiden victory. “If celebration means a couple of glasses of wine while watching the baby monitor this evening and watching Match of the Day, then that will be it. That’s the way life is these days!” he said. “For me, I am happy, very happy with the result. We want to win games, I want to stay in contention. “I didn’t want a slow start. We had a tough start and I have got to say I am happy with a lot of the performances. “But you can’t shout that too loudly if you aren’t winning games. So it changes it for me, today. So I am very happy. “It gives me more determination to work. I saw a lot of good things, things we can improve but a real good belief in the players, the way they played today. I am happy, but determined, I suppose.”
