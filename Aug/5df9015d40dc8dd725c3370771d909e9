Gov, Nyesom Wike of  Rivers has directed environmental service providers to clean up their respective beats within seven days.  The governor gave the directive at an interactive meeting with the service providers of the Rivers State Waste Management Agency (RIWAMA) on Monday at the Government House, Port Harcourt. Wike said his administration was committed to returning Port Harcourt to its Garden City status  and warned that sanitation service providers found wanting would have their contracts revoked. He also stated that the Rivers Government would improve the sanitary condition of Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor Local Government areas through diligent implementation of environmental sanitation agenda of his administration. Wike said: “As I go out daily, I feel unhappy because of the filth in different parts of the  state capital. The job of cleaning this town must be done. “At present, Port Harcourt is dirty and we must accept this fact. I stated this during  my inauguration address. But we are determined to change the situation.’’ Wike charged all environmental service providers to live up their responsibilities  and justify the fees paid them by the state government. “I was not the person who awarded the contracts.  I don’t even know the contractors. I have not restricted contracts to my supporters. Several of you are from the opposition parties. “But we must endeavour to ensure that all parts of the state capital remain clean,’’ he said. Wike and the Environmental Sanitation Service Providers of RIWAMA also deliberated on the sanitation beats  in Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor Local Government areas.
