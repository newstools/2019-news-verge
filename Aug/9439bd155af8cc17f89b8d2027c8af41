In an effort to serve customers more efficiently and deepen its digital drive, leading consumer finance firm, Zedvance, has launched a dedicated mobile lending app – MoneyPal. Announcing the introduction of the channel, Chief Operating Officer, Zedvance Limited, Mr. Jerry Osagie said, “Our investment in digitalizing our business has allowed us to anticipate and meet our customer needs in increasingly efficient ways. This has also allowed us to disburse loans to customers round-the-clock in a few minutes, ensuring that we are always there for our customers.” The recently launched channel is part of Zedvance’s #Madeforyou campaign designed to emphasise the company’s readiness to cater to customers’ instant loan needs. Besides the app-based platform, Zedvance also services its numerous customers through its website (www.zedvance.com), phone calls to its Contact Center on 07001001000, Zee, a Whatsapp chatbot; and a number of Sales agents. According to Osagie, “With the MoneyPal app, subscribers can request for Zedvance Nano loans -typically low-ticket loans which are payable within a short time; or salary-based loans -of up to N5million and at tenures of up to 24months at amazing interest rates.” In business since 2015, Zedvance has traditionally provided loans to only salary earners in the public and private sectors. With the launch of the MoneyPal app however, the company will now be able to cater to the lending needs of non-salary earners as it seeks to deepen its financial inclusion strategy across the country. “Our aim is to be a true partner for success – enhancing the lifestyle of every Nigerian by providing access to credit through different offline and online channels, hence the launch of the #MadeForYou Campaign. Each of our application channels was specially made for our customers’ convenience”, concluded Osagie. The app is now available for download on the Google Play Store for Android devices and will soon be launched on the Apple Store for iOS users.
