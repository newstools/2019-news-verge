The Chairman of Bwari Area Council, Mr John Gabaya has assured members of the National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) of his administration’s readiness to improve on their welfare.  Gabaya gave the assurance when representatives of the FCT NYSC Secretariat, and some members of the NYSC 2019 Batch B’, paid him a courtesy visit on Wednesday in Abuja. Gabaya, who appreciated the team for the gesture, said that it was the duty of the council, as host of the NYSC Orientation Camp in the city to ensure it gave the Corps maximum support. He aknowledeged the fact that the camp in Kubwa, was faced with infrastructure challenges, adding that efforts would be made to amendments it and bring succour to the corps members. “The council, in it’s capacity, alongside the management of the scheme, would meet and discuss how it would make the development feasible including our best effort to add a little raise to their allowance,” Gabaya said. Earlier, the NYSC FCT Coordinator, Mrs Waleeda Isa, said the visit was to acquaint its officials with the new administration of the council as host of the orientation camp. Isa decried the sorry state of infrastructure at the NYSC camp, saying “their lodge in the camp is dilapidated and needs attention”. “Also, it would go a long way for those who serve under the council, if your administration can kindly add a little to their allowance to augment what Federal Government is giving them. “We will be honoured if you make these efforts so that we feel your presence and know that you have us at heart,” she said. It was reported that the NYSC 2019 Batch B’ corp members have reported and would be inaugurated at the orientation camp on Aug. 22.
