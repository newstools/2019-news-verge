The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), has concluded plans to extend National Identification Number (NIN) enrolment to Nigerians in the Diaspora, who are residing in Austria and Germany.  Mr Aliyu Aziz the Director-General, NIMC, disclosed this in a statement issued by Mr Abdulhamid Umar, General Manager, Operations/Corporate Communications, NIMC on Tuesday in Abuja. Aziz said that the exercise would involve the demographic and biometric data capture of Nigerians residing in Austria and Germany in collaboration with Biosec Solution Limited, licensed by NIMC to carry out enrolment across the globe. He noted that the extension was to ensure that Nigerians in Diaspora were captured in the process. He said that it was in line with NIMC’s mandate to populate the National Identity Database (NIDB) and issue the NIN to all Nigerians and legal residents. Aziz also reiterated that the NIN was a mandatory requirement for many services. They include the acquisition and renewal of the International Passport, Bank account opening in Nigeria, Tax filing in Nigeria, and Business registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission amongst others. According to him, the launch of the new Centres will hold on Aug. 21, 2019 in Austria, Vienna at the Embassy/Permanent Mission of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
