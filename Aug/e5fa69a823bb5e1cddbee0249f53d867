The Yoruba Youth Socio-cultural Association (YYSA) has commended the Federal Government’s move to evolve an alternate Big Brother Naija (BBN) show which would reflect the true Nigerian culture.  The National Secretary of the association, Mr Olawale Ajao, said in a statement on Monday in Osogbo that live sex during the ongoing BBN reality show was eroding the culture and values of Nigerians. Recall that the Federal Government had lodged a complaint with the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) on the live sex being exhibited during the reality show. Mr Segun Runsewe, the Director-General, National Council for Arts and Culture, had disclosed this on Friday when the President of the National Council of Women Societies, Dr Gloria Shoda, visited him. Runsewe said government had also concluded arrangements with Startimes to evolve a modified BBN that would reflect the true Nigerian culture with local dishes and clothes promoted. Ajao described the partnership of the National Council of Arts and Culture with NBC to ensure a show that would be devoid of nudity, live sex and other acts of immortality as commendable . “One of the esteemed values we are known for that has made us to be dignified is the culture of secrecy. “Before now, sexual intercourse  used to take place without the awareness of even the children, let alone neighbours. “Our dressing, food and the way we talk are distinctly different from that of the white people. “But the moment we began to emulate the immorality of the western world, we became corrosive. “For us to redeem our image as a people, all forms of nudity and immorality must be prohibited. “The step, when taken, will give responsible and cultured Nigerians the privilege to showcase their talents and participate meaningfully in the show,” he said.
