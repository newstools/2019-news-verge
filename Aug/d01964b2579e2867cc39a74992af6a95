When it comes to fable semi-conductors and chips that smart TVs, Voice Assistant Devices (VAD), Android tablets, feature phones, Optical and Blu-ray DVD players and the rest, Mediatek comes 4th in the world but a particular Processor from the Taiwanese giant that deserves scrutiny is the MediaTek Helio P25 Processor. The Helio P25 has been used widely in mobile phones by different brands because of the fact that it was specifically made for dual-camera phones, an example is the popular Tecno Phantom 8 Smartphone. As a premium performance chip within the MediaTek Helio family, MediaTek Helio P25 combines the power of 16nm Octa-core processing with a superior ISP built with dual camera devices in mind. Designed for Android smartphones that aim to differentiate through exceptional camera features and overall premium image quality, the two camera captors allow up to 13MP each or a single captor up to 24MP. By adopting a 16nm FinFET+ process node, MediaTek Helio P25 offers an Octa-core Cortex-A53 processor clocked at up to 2.6GHz that delivers more power while using less energy than competing solutions.
