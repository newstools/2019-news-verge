The Nigerian equities market opened trading for the week on Monday on a negative trend with the All-Share Index dropping by 0.39 per cent, due to sell pressure.  Specifically, the All Share Index lost 108.32 points or 0.39 per cent, dropping to 27,691.85 against 27,800.17 achieved on Friday. Also, investors lost N52 billion in value as the market capitalisation closed lower at N13.472 trillion compared with N13.524 trillion on Friday. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Seplat, Forte Oil, Julius Berger, International Breweries and Cement Company of Northern Nigeria. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited expect the bearish performance to continue as investor sentiment remains weak. Also, analysts at Imperial Asset Managers Limited expect bargain hunting on stocks that have witnessed significant price deceleration to be prominent this week. They say they, however, do not rule out the possibility of profit taking, considering current investors’ weak confidence on the market. Market breadth closed negative, with 19 gainers and 21 decliners. Forte Oil and Seplat led the losers’ chart by 10 per cent each, to close at N14.40 and N441 per share respectively. Julius Berger came second, losing 9.95 per cent to close at N18.55 per share.
