Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State has warned 12 newly appointed Permanent Secretaries in the state civil service against lobbying for lucrative postings.  Tambuwal issued the warning shortly after the swearing in of the 12 officials held in the council chamber of the Government House in Sokoto on Wednesday. “Our present administration would not condone disloyalty or incompetence in service and any one that possessed such attributes would be shown the way out. “I wish to congratulate the new appointees whose appointment were based on merit and charge them to work harder for the overall development of the civil service in Sokoto State. “Moreover, you should remain more committed as new challenges are coming ahead in your carrier and as a government we would not accept slow motion in service delivery,” he said. The governor further explained that all the appointees were worthy, credible and competent technocrats and urged them to work hard for the people of the state. He said that the government would reorganise the state bureaucracy and implored public servants to always be loyal and competent in the discharge of their duties.
