Following the arrest of the convener of #RevolutionNow August 5 protest, Mr. Omoyele Sowore, the Department of State Security Service (DSS) on Sunday confirmed his arrest but declined to comment whether Mr Sowore is at its Lagos or Abuja office. Spokesman of the commission, Peter Afunaya, made the disclosure at a news briefing in Abuja. Mr Afunaya said that the DSS is acting within its constitutional powers to arrest and detain anybody or group who threatens the unity and peaceful co-existence of Nigeria. He added that the call for revolution poses as a national security threat. The former Presidential Aspirant, African Action Congress, activist and publisher of online news platform SaharaReporters was forcefully picked up at his apartment in the early hours of Saturday. His arrest by operatives of the Department of State Services was confirmed by his personal assistant who claimed to have witnessed the incident. The news website said its publisherâ€™s arrest was not unconnected to #RevolutionNow, a series of planned protests against bad governance in the country scheduled for August 5, 2019. However, several prominent Nigerians including, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Oby Ezekwesili, Shehu Sani have called for the release of Mr Sowore.
