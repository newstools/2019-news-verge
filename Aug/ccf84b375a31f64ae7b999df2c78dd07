President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday said the devastation that accompanied Cyclone Idai, which ravaged Zimbabwe earlier in the year, was so enormous that Nigeria had to offer a helping hand.  President Buhari disclosed this when he received the out-going Ambassador of Zimbabwe to Nigeria, Lovemore Mazemo at State House, Abuja. “It was a major disaster, and it caused damage in billions of dollars. Nigeria, despite our own challenges, had to provide aid to ameliorate the situation,” he said. The president added that he was glad that the outgoing Ambassador and his country appreciated the hand of fellowship. Cyclone Idai ravaged Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Malawi, and is believed to be the costliest natural disaster in South-West Indian Ocean basin. Goods and properties estimated at two billion dollars were lost. President Buhari also recalled the role Nigeria played to secure the Independence of Zimbabwe from apartheid minority rule, noting: “We remain proud of what Nigeria did in those days.” Mazemo, who spent four-and-a-half years in Nigeria, said he found a home here, “and a family among your wonderful people.” He maintained that the assistance given by Nigeria after the cyclone “went a long way to relieve our people.” The ambassador noted that relationship between the two countries had improved tremendously in recent years. The Ambassador congratulated President Buhari on the confidence reposed in him by his people, making them to elect him twice. He equally lauded him for the leadership he has provided for Africa in the war against corruption.
