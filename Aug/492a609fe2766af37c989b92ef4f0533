The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied allegations of raiding the residence of former Governor of Lagos, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode.  EFCC acting spokesman, Mr Tony Orilade denied the allegations in a statement issued in Abuja on Tuesday. There were reports in the early hours of Tuesday that operatives of the anti-graft agency had raided Ambode’s home. “Since early hours of today, I have been inundated with calls that operatives of the Commission raided the residence of the former governor of Lagos, Akinwunmi Ambode. “We need to state for the records that the EFCC did not raid Ambode’s house. “It is instructive that his administration, like other former governors is under investigation, since they no longer constitutionally enjoy immunity against prosecution. “The commission hereby states with high sense of responsibility that the operatives did not raid Ambode’s residence.” He said that whatever the commission was presently doing with regards to the investigation was in line with its mandate and the Rule of Law. “We wish to inform the social media to be circumspect in the reportage of any news with regards to investigation activities of the commission. “As a tradition, the commission does not carry out investigation on the pages of the newspapers or through the media. “Our operations are always covert until at a time when we file charges in court. “Therefore, the attempt to cast the commission in a bad light is unacceptable as the EFCC will never engage in illegal act. “We remain committed to the war against corruption,” Orilade said.
